The Semanticscience Integrated Ontology (SIO) provides a simple, integrated ontology of types and relations for rich description of objects, processes and their attributes. The SIO paper is [available](http://www.jbiomedsem.com/content/5/1/14).  

The OWL2 ontology is available at http://semanticscience.org/ontology/sio.owl

This project provides ontological support for 
* [Bio2RDF](http://bio2rdf.org/) Linked Data for the Life Sciences 
* [SADI Semantic Web Services](http://sadiframework.org). 
* [DisGeNET](http://rdf.imim.es/DisGeNET.html)'s gene-disease associations 
* The NCBI's [PubChem RDF](http://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/rdf/) for measurement values 
* The EBI's [Gene Expression Atlas](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/rdf/documentation/atlas) . 

If you have questions please send to SIO mailing list (sio-ontology@googlegroups.com; http://groups.google.com/group/sio-ontology). If you have term requests, just use the [issue tracker](https://github.com/micheldumontier/semanticscience/issues).

Design patterns help in defining a structure for common data types. These are currently at the [old google code site](https://code.google.com/p/semanticscience/wiki/SIO)

Subsets/Slims. Subsets of SIO have been prepared for modular import. 
* [labels as SIO URIs](https://github.com/micheldumontier/semanticscience/tree/master/ontology/sio/release/sio-subset-labels.owl)
* [other subsets including core, chemical, nlm, etc](https://github.com/micheldumontier/semanticscience/tree/master/ontology/sio/release/)
