NumPy is a replacement of Numeric Python that adds the features of numarray.
To install system-wide on Unix-like systems:

sudo python setup.py install

or (for system without sudo):

su -c python setup.py install

On windows, it is advised to use the official binaries.

The setup.py script will take advantage of fast BLAS on your system if it can
find it.  You can guide the process using a site.cfg file.

If fast BLAS and LAPACK cannot be found, then a slower default version is used.

After installation, tests can be run (from outside the source
directory) with:

python -c 'import numpy; numpy.test()'

Please note that you must have version 0.10 or later of the 'nose' test
framework installed in order to run the tests.  More information about nose is
available here:

The most current development version of NumPy is always available from our
subversion repository:
