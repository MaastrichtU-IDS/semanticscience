PREREQUISITES
=============

Building NumPy requires the following software installed:

1) Python__ 2.4.x or newer

   On Debian and derivative (Ubuntu): python python-dev

   On Windows: the official python installer on Python__ is enough

   Make sure that the Python package distutils is installed before
   continuing. For example, in Debian GNU/Linux, distutils is included
   in the python-dev package.

   Python must also be compiled with the zlib module enabled.
