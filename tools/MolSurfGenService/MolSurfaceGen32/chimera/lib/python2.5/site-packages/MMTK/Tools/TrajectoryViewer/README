This directory contains a useful tool for inspecting trajectories.
Just type

     python TrajectoryViewer.py some_trajectory.nc

and play around with the menus. Animation requires an external
viewer that supports animation and which is supported by MMTK.
Currently only VMD and XMol meet those requirements.


There is a rather experimental support for inspecting remote
trajectories, i.e. trajectories that reside on other machines. I use
this on a cluster of Linux PCs and haven't tested it on anything else.
To use this feature, you must have Pyro, which is available at

      http://www.xs4all.nl/~asz00557/ap/pyro.html

You must configure Pyro properly on all the machines and start a Pyro
nameserver before you can use the remote trajectory facility, which
can be controlled by the script manager.py. After a trajectory has
been published (this must be done on the machine where it resides),
it can be accessed from all other machines that have access to the
same Pyro namespace.
