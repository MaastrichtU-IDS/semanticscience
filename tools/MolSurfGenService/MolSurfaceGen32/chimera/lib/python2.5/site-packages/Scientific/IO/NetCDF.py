        A NetCDFFile object has two standard attributes: 'dimensions' and
        'variables'. The values of both are dictionaries, mapping dimension
        names to their associated lengths and variable names to variables,
        respectively. Application programs should never modify these
        dictionaries.

        All other attributes correspond to global attributes defined in the
        netCDF file. Global file attributes are created by assigning to
        an attribute of the NetCDFFile object.

        Variable in a netCDF file

        NetCDFVariable objects are constructed by calling the method
        'createVariable' on the L{NetCDFFile} object.

        NetCDFVariable objects behave much like array objects defined
        in module Numeric, except that their data resides in a file.
        Data is read by indexing and written by assigning to an
        indexed subset; the entire array can be accessed by the index
        '[:]' or using the methods 'getValue' and
        'assignValue'. NetCDFVariable objects also have attribute
        "shape" with the same meaning as for arrays, but the shape
        cannot be modified. There is another read-only attribute
        "dimensions", whose value is the tuple of dimension names.

        All other attributes correspond to variable attributes defined in the
        netCDF file. Variable attributes are created by assigning to
        an attribute of the NetCDFVariable object. 

        B{Note:}
        If a file open for reading is simultaneously written by another program,
        the size of the unlimited dimension may change. Every time the shape
        of a variable is requested, the current size will be obtained from
        the file. For reading and writing, the size obtained during the last
        shape request is used. This ensures consistency: foo[-1] means the
        same thing no matter how often it is evaluated, as long as the shape
        is not re-evaluated in between.
