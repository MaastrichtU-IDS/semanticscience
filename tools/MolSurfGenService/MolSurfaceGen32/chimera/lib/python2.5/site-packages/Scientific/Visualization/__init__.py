Scientific visualization

The modules in this subpackage provide visualization of 3D objects
using different backends (VRML, VMD, VPython), but with an almost
identical interface. It is thus possible to write generic 3D graphics
code in which the backend can be changed by modifying a single line
of code.

The intended application of these modules is scientific visualization.
Many sophisticated 3D objects are therefore absent, as are complex
surface definitions such as textures.
