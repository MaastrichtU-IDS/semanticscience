<h1>
Output Surfaces in Wavefront OBJ format
</h1>

<p>
</p>

<p>
This extension writes out msms molecular surfaces, volume viewer
contour surfaces and multiscale surfaces in Wavefront OBJ format.  Only
displayed surfaces are written out.  OBJ output is written using menu
entry:
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 50px">File / Export Scene...</p>

<p>
You specify the path for the OBJ file.  A second file containing the
colors is also written.  The name of this material file is obtained by
stripping .obj, .OBJ, or .Obj from the obj file name and adding .mtl (or
.MTL or .Mtl).  Vertex positions and normals are written.
</p>

<h2>
Problems
</h2>

<p>
<b>Per vertex colors not output.</b>
Chimera surface models can have a different color at every surface vertex.
This extension does not output these "per vertex" colors.  Only a single
color is output per surface component.  I did not have adequate documentation
for Wavefront OBJ format to include per vertex colors.
</p>

<p>
<b>Entire surfaces are output.</b>
Even if just part of surface is displayed, the whole surface is exported.

<b>July 27, 2005</b>.<br>
Original implementation.

Export surface positions using coordinates shown in Chimera window.
Registed file exporter with Export Scene dialog and removed menu entry from
Tools / Utilities menu.
