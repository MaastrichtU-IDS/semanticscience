      in several forms:
      <ul>
        <li><a href="toc.html">Plain HTML</a></li>
        <li><a href="frame.html">Version using frames</a></li>
        <li><a href="idx.html">Index to search for keywords</a></li>

      Frequently Asked Questions list before asking any support-related questions on
      the internet or other locations.
