<h3><a name="s03_06_03">3.6.3 </a>Photons</h3>

<h4><a name="s03_06_03_01">3.6.3.1 </a>Overview</h4>

<p>
  The basic goal of this implementation of the photon map is to render true reflective and refractive caustics. The 
 photon map was first introduced by Henrik Wann Jensen (see <a href="s_91.html#s02_05_05">Suggested Reading</a>). 
</p>

<p>
  Photon mapping is a technique which uses a forward ray-tracing pre-processing step to render refractive and 
 reflective caustics realistically. This means that mirrors can reflect light rays and lenses can focus light. 
</p>

<p>
  Photon mapping works by shooting packets of light (photons) from light sources into the scene. The photons are 
 directed towards specific objects. When a photon hits an object after passing through (or bouncing off of) the target 
 object, the ray intersection is stored in memory. This data is later used to estimate the amount of light contributed 
 by reflective and refractive caustics. 
</p>

<h5><a name="s03_06_03_01_01">3.6.3.1.1 </a>Examples</h5>

<p>
  <img align="center" alt="Reflective caustics" src="images/reference/photons1.png"> 
</p>

<p>
  This image shows refractive caustics from a sphere and a cylinder. Both use an index of refraction of <code>1.2</code>. 
 Also visible is a small amount of reflective caustics from the metal sphere, and also from the clear cylinder and 
 sphere. 
</p>

<p>
  <img alt="Photons used for lenses and caustics" src="images/reference/photons2.png"> 
</p>

<p>
  Here we have three lenses and three light sources. The middle lens has photon mapping turned off. You can also see 
 some reflective caustics from the brass box (some light reflects and hits the blue box, other light bounces through 
 the nearest lens and is focused in the lower left corner of the image). 
</p>

<h4><a name="s03_06_03_02">3.6.3.2 </a>Using Photon Mapping in Your Scene</h4>

<p>
  When designing a scene with photons, it helps to think of the scene objects in two categories. Objects in the first 
 category will show photon caustics when hit by photons. Objects in the second category cause photon caustics by 
 reflecting or refracting photons. Some objects may be in both categories, and some objects may be in neither category. 
</p>

<p>
  Category 1 - Objects that show photon caustics 
</p>

<p>
  By default, all objects are in the first category. Whenever a photon hits an object, the photon is stored and will 
 later be used to render caustics on that object. This means that, by default, caustics from photons can appear on any 
 surface. To speed up rendering, you can take objects out of this category. You do this with the line: <code>photons{collect 
 off}</code>. If you use this syntax, caustics from photons will not appear on the object. This will save both memory 
 and computational time during rendering. 
</p>

<p>
  Category 2 - Objects that cause photon caustics 
</p>

<p>
  By default, there are no objects in the second category. If you want your object to cause caustics, you need to do 
 two things. First, make your object into a &quot;target.&quot; You do this with the <code>target</code> keyword. This 
 enables light sources to shoot photons at your object. Second, you need to specify if your object reflects photons, 
 refracts photons, or both. This is done with the <code>reflection on</code> and <code>refraction on</code> keywords. 
 To allow an object to reflect and refract photons, you would use the following lines of code inside the object: 
</p>

<pre>
photons{
  target
  reflection on
  refraction on
}
</pre>

<p>
  Generally speaking, you do not want an object to be in both categories. Most objects that cause photon caustics do 
 not themselves have much color or brightness. Usually they simply refract or reflect their surroundings. For this 
 reason, it is usually a waste of time to display photon caustics on such surfaces. Even if computed, the effects from 
 the caustics would be so dim that they would go unnoticed. 
</p>

<p>
  Sometimes, you may also wish to add <code>photons{collect off}</code> to other clear or reflective objects, even if 
 they are not photon targets. Again, this is done to prevent unnecessary computation of caustic lighting. 
</p>

<p>
  Finally, you may wish to enable photon reflection and refraction for a surface, even if it is not a target. This 
 allows indirect photons (photons that have already hit a target and been reflected or refracted) to continue their 
 journey after hitting this object.

  refraction    : off
  reflection    : off

</pre>

<p>
  To specify photon gathering and storage options you need to add a photons block to the global_settings section of 
 your scene. 
</p>

<p>
  For example: 
</p>

<pre>
 global_settings {
   photons {
     count 20000
     autostop 0
     jitter .4
   }
 }
</pre>

<p>
  The number of photons generated can be set using either the spacing or count keywords: 
</p>

<ul>
 <a name="s03_06_03_02_01_i4"><a name="spacing"></a>
 <li>
   If spacing is used, it specifies approximately the average distance between photons on surfaces. If you cut the 
  spacing in half, you will get four times as many surface photons, and eight times as many media photons. 
 </li>

 <li>
   If count is used, POV-Ray will shoot the approximately number of photons specified. The actual number of photons 
  that result from this will almost always be at least slightly different from the number specified. Still, if you 
  double the photons_to_shoot value, then twice as many photons will be shot. If you cut the value in half, then half 
  the number of photons will be shot. 
  <ul>
   
   <li>
     It may be less, because POV shoots photons at a target object's bounding box, which means that some photons 
    will miss the target object. 
   </li>

   <li>
     On the other hand, may be more, because each time one object hits an object that has both reflection and 
    refraction, two photons are created (one for reflection and one for refraction). 
   </li>

   <li>
     POV will attempt to compensate for these two factors, but it can only estimate how many photons will actually 
    be generated. Sometimes this estimation is rather poor, but the feature is still usable. 
   </li>

  </ul>
   
 </li>

</ul>
<a name="s03_06_03_02_01_i5"><a name="gather"></a>
<p>
  The keyword <code>gather</code> allows you to specify how many photons are gathered at each point during the 
 regular rendering step. The first number (default 20) is the minimum number to gather, while the second number 
 (default 100) is the maximum number to gather. These are good values and you should only use different ones if you 
 know what you are doing.<a name="s03_06_03_02_01_i6"><a name="media, photons"></a><a name="s03_06_03_02_01_i7"><a name="photons, media"></a> 
 
</p>

<p>
  The keyword <code>media</code> turns on media photons. The parameter <code>max_steps</code> specifies the maximum 
 number of photons to deposit over an interval. The optional parameter factor specifies the difference in media spacing 
 compared to surface spacing. You can increase factor and decrease max_steps if too many photons are being deposited in 
 media.<a name="s03_06_03_02_01_i8"> 
</p>

<p>
  The keyword <code>jitter</code> specifies the amount of jitter used in the sampling of light rays in the 
 pre-processing step. The default value is good and usually does not need to be changed.<a name="s03_06_03_02_01_i9"><a name="s03_06_03_02_01_i10"> 
 
</p>

<p>
  The keywords <code>max_trace_level</code> and <code>adc_bailout</code> allow you to specify these attributes for 
 the photon-tracing step. If you do not specify these, the values for the primary ray-tracing step will be used.<a name="s03_06_03_02_01_i11"><a name="load_file, photons"></a><a name="s03_06_03_02_01_i12"><a name="save_file, photons"></a> 
 
</p>

<p>
  The keywords <code>save_file</code> and <code>load_file</code> allow you to save and load photon maps. If you load 
 a photon map, no photons will be shot. The photon map file contains all surface (caustic) and media photons.<a name="s03_06_03_02_01_i13"><a name="radius, photons"></a> 
 
</p>

<p>
  <code>radius</code> is used for gathering photons. The larger the radius, the longer it takes to gather photons. 
 But if you use too small of a radius, you might not get enough photons to get a good estimate. Therefore, choosing a 
 good radius is important. Normally POV-Ray looks through the photon map and uses some ad-hoc statistical analysis to 
 determine a reasonable radius. Sometimes it does a good job, sometimes it does not. The radius keyword lets you 
 override or adjust POV-Ray's guess. 
</p>

<p>
  <code>radius</code> parameters (all are optional): 
</p>

<ol>
 
 <li>
   Manually set the gather radius for surface photons. If this is either zero or if you leave it out, POV-Ray will 
  analyze and guess. 
 </li>

 <li>
   Adjust the radius for surface photons by setting a multiplier. If POV-Ray, for example, is picking a radius that 
  you think is too big (render is too slow), you can use &quot;<code>radius ,0.5</code>&quot; to lower the radius 
  (multiply by 0.5) and speed up the render at the cost of quality. 
 </li>

 <li>
   Manually set the gather radius for media photons. 
 </li>

 <li>
   Adjust the radius for media photons by setting a multiplier. 
 </li>

</ol>
<a name="s03_06_03_02_01_i14"><a name="autostop"></a>
<p>
  The keywords <code><a href="s_130.html#s03_06_03_05_01">autostop</a></code> and <code><a href="s_130.html#s03_06_03_05_02">expand_thresholds</a></code> 
 will be explained later.

<h5><a name="s03_06_03_02_02">3.6.3.2.2 </a>Shooting Photons at an Object</h5>

<pre>
object_photon_block:
photons {
  [target [&lt;spacing_multiplier&gt;]]
  [refraction on|off]
  [reflection on|off]
  [collect on|off]
  [pass_through]
}
</pre>

<p>
  To shoot photons at an object, you need to tell POV that the object receives photons. To do this, create a <code>photons 
 { }</code> block within the object. For example: 
</p>

<pre>
 object {
   MyObject
   photons {
     target
     refraction on
     reflection on
     collect off
   }
 }
</pre>

<p>
  In this example, the object both reflects and refracts photons. Either of these options could be turned off (by 
 specifying reflection off, for example). By using this, you can have an object with a reflective finish which does not 
 reflect photons for speed and memory reasons.<a name="s03_06_03_02_02_i1"><a name="target"></a> 
</p>

<p>
  The keyword <code>target</code> makes this object a target.<a name="s03_06_03_02_02_i2"><a name="spacing_multiplier"></a> 
 
</p>

<p>
  The density of the photons can be adjusted by specifying the <code>spacing_multiplier</code>. If, for example, you 
 specify a <code>spacing_multiplier</code> of 0.5, then the spacing for photons hitting this object will be 1/2 of the 
 distance of the spacing for other objects. 
</p>

<p class="Note">
  <strong>Note:</strong> This means four times as many surface photons, and eight times as many media 
 photons.<a name="s03_06_03_02_02_i3"><a name="collect"></a> 
</p>

<p>
  The keyword <code>collect off</code> causes the object to ignore photons. Photons are neither deposited nor 
 gathered on that object.<a name="s03_06_03_02_02_i4"><a name="pass_through"></a> 
</p>

<p>
  The keyword <code>pass_through</code> causes photons to pass through the object <strong>unaffected</strong> on 
 their way to a target object. Once a photon hits the target object, it will ignore the <code>pass_through</code> flag. 
 This is basically a photon version of the <code>no_shadow</code> keyword, with the exception that media within the 
 object will still be affected by the photons (unless that media specifies collect off). If you use the <code>no_shadow</code> 
 keyword, the object will be tagged as <code>pass_through</code> automatically. You can then turn off <code>pass_through</code> 
 if necessary by simply using <code>photons { pass_through off }</code>. 
</p>

<p class="Note">
  <strong>Note:</strong> Photons will not be shot at an object unless you specify the <code>target</code> 
 keyword. Simply turning refraction on will not suffice. 
</p>

<p>
  When shooting photons at a CSG-union, it may sometimes be of advantage to use <code><a href="s_110.html#s03_04_06_02_01">split_union 
 off</a></code> inside the union. POV-Ray will be forced to shoot at the whole object, instead of splitting it up and 
 shooting photons at its compound parts. 
</p>

<h5><a name="s03_06_03_02_03">3.6.3.2.3 </a>Photons and Light Sources</h5>
<a name="s03_06_03_02_03_i1">
<pre>
 light_photon_block:
 photons {
   [refraction on | off]
   [reflection on | off]
   [area_light]
 }
</pre>

<p>
  Example: 
</p>

<pre>
 light_source {
   MyLight
   photons {
     refraction on
     reflection on
   }
 }
</pre>

<p>
  Sometimes, you want photons to be shot from one light source and not another. In that case, you can turn photons on 
 for an object, but specify <code>photons { reflection off refraction off }</code> in the light source's definition. 
 You can also turn off only reflection or only refraction for any light source. 
</p>

<h5><a name="s03_06_03_02_04">3.6.3.2.4 </a>Photons and Media</h5>
<a name="s03_06_03_02_04_i1">
<pre>
 global_settings {
   photons {
     count 10000
     media 100
   }
 }
</pre>

<p>
  Photons also interact fully with media. This means that volumetric photons are stored in scattering media. This is 
 enabled by using the keyword media within the photons block. 
</p>

<p>
  To store photons in media, POV deposits photons as it steps through the media during the photon-tracing phase of 
 the render. It will deposit these photons as it traces caustic photons, so the number of media photons is dependent on 
 the number of caustic photons. As a light ray passes through a section of media, the photons are deposited, separated 
 by approximately the same distance that separates surface photons. 
</p>

<p>
  You can specify a factor as a second optional parameter to the media keyword. If, for example, factor is set to 
 2.0, then photons will be spaced twice as far apart as they would otherwise have been spaced. 
</p>

<p>
  Sometimes, however, if a section of media is very large, using these settings could create a large number of 
 photons very fast and overload memory. Therefore, following the media keyword, you must specify the maximum number of 
 photons that are deposited for each ray that travels through each section of media. A setting of 100 should probably 
 work in most cases. 
</p>

<p>
  You can put <code>collect off</code> into media to make that media ignore photons. Photons will neither be 
 deposited nor gathered in a media that is ignoring them. Photons will also not be gathered nor deposited in 
 non-scattering media. However, if multiple medias exist in the same space, and at least one does not ignore photons 
 and is scattering, then photons will be deposited in that interval and will be gathered for use with all media in that 
 interval. 
</p>

<h4><a name="s03_06_03_03">3.6.3.3 </a>Photons FAQ</h4>

<p>
  <em>I made an object with IOR 1.0 and the shadows look weird.</em> 
</p>

<p>
  If the borders of your shadows look odd when using photon mapping, do not be alarmed. This is an unfortunate 
 side-effect of the method. If you increase the density of photons (by decreasing spacing and gather radius) you will 
 notice the problem diminish. We suggest not using photons if your object does not cause much refraction (such as with 
 a window pane or other flat piece of glass or any objects with an IOR very close to 1.0). 
</p>

<p>
  <em>My scene takes forever to render.</em> 
</p>

<p>
  When POV-Ray builds the photon maps, it continually displays in the status bar the number of photons that have been 
 shot. Is POV-Ray stuck in this step and does it keep shooting lots and lots of photons? 
</p>

<p>
  <em>yes</em> 
</p>

<p>
  If you are shooting photons at an infinite object (like a plane), then you should expect this. Either be patient or 
 do not shoot photons at infinite objects. 
</p>

<p>
  Are you shooting photons at a CSG difference? Sometimes POV-Ray does a bad job creating bounding boxes for these 
 objects. And since photons are shot at the bounding box, you could get bad results. Try manually bounding the object. 
 You can also try the autostop feature (try <code>autostop 0</code>). See the docs for more info on autostop. 
</p>

<p>
  <em>no</em> 
</p>

<p>
  Does your scene have lots of glass (or other clear objects)? Glass is slow and you need to be patient. 
</p>

<p>
  <em>My scene has polka dots but renders really quickly. Why?</em> 
</p>

<p>
  You should increase the number of photons (or decrease the spacing). 
</p>

<p>
  <em>The photons in my scene show up only as small, bright dots. How can I fix this?</em> 
</p>

<p>
  The automatic calculation of the gather radius is probably not working correctly, most likely because there are 
 many photons not visible in your scene which are affecting the statistical analysis. 
</p>

<p>
  You can fix this by either reducing the number of photons that are in your scene but not visible to the camera 
 (which confuse the auto-computation), or by specifying the initial gather radius manually by using the keyword radius. 
 If you must manually specify a gather radius, it is usually best to also use spacing instead of count, and then set 
 radius and spacing to a 5:1 (radius:spacing) ratio. 
</p>

<p>
  <em>Adding photons slowed down my scene a lot, and I see polka dots.</em> 
</p>

<p>
  This is usually caused by having both high- and low-density photons in the same scene. The low density ones cause 
 polka dots, while the high density ones slow down the scene. It is usually best if the all photons are on the same 
 order of magnitude for spacing and brightness. Be careful if you are shooting photons objects close to and far from a 
 light source. There is an optional parameter to the target keyword which allows you to adjust the spacing of photons 
 at the target object. You may need to adjust this factor for objects very close to or surrounding the light source. 
</p>

<p>
  <em>I added photons, but I do not see any caustics.</em> 
</p>

<p>
  When POV-Ray builds the photon maps, it continually displays in the status bar the number of photons that have been 
 shot. Did it show any photons being shot? 
</p>

<p>
  <em>no</em> 
</p>

<p>
  Try avoiding <code>autostop</code>, or you might want to bound your object manually. 
</p>

<p>
  Try increasing the number of photons (or decreasing the spacing). 
</p>

<p>
  <em>yes</em> 
</p>

<p>
  <em>Were any photons stored (the number after <code>total</code> in the rendering message as POV-Ray shoots 
 photons)?</em> 
</p>

<p>
  <em>no</em> 
</p>

<p>
  It is possible that the photons are not hitting the target object (because another object is between the light 
 source and the other object). 
</p>

<p>
  <em>yes</em> 
</p>

<p>
  The photons may be diverging more than you expect. They are probably there, but you cannot see them since they are 
 spread out too much 
</p>

<p>
  <em>The base of my glass object is really bright.</em> 
</p>

<p>
  Use <code>collect off</code> with that object. 
</p>

<p>
  <em>Will area lights work with photon mapping?</em> 
</p>

<p>
  Photons do work with area lights. However, normally photon mapping ignores all area light options and treats all 
 light sources as point lights. If you would like photon mapping to use your area light options, you must specify the 
 &quot;area_light&quot; keyword <strong>within</strong> the <code>photons { }</code> block in your light source's code. 
 Doing this will not increase the number of photons shot by the light source, but it might cause regular patterns to 
 show up in the rendered caustics (possibly splotchiness). 
</p>

<p>
  <em>What do the stats mean?</em> 
</p>

<p>
  In the stats, <code>photons shot</code> means how many light rays were shot from the light sources. <code>photons 
 stored</code> means how many photons are deposited on surfaces in the scene. If you turn on reflection and refraction, 
 you could get more photons stored than photons shot, since the each ray can get split into two. 
</p>

<h4><a name="s03_06_03_04">3.6.3.4 </a>Photon Tips</h4>

<ul>
 
 <ul>
  
  <li>
    Use <code>collect off</code> in objects that photons do not hit. Just put <code>photons { collect off }</code> 
   in the object's definition. 
  </li>

  <li>
    Use <code>collect off</code> in glass objects. 
  </li>

  <li>
    Use <code>autostop</code> unless it causes problems. 
  </li>

  <li>
    A big tip is to make sure that all of the final densities of photons are of the same general magnitude. You do 
   not want spots with really high density photons and another area with really low density photons. You will always 
   have some variation (which is a good thing), but having really big differences in photon density is what causes some 
   scenes to take many hours to render. 
  </li>

 </ul>

</ul>

<h4><a name="s03_06_03_05">3.6.3.5 </a>Advanced Techniques</h4>

<p>
  <img alt="Example of the photon autostop option" src="images/reference/shootph.png"> 
</p>

<p>
  To understand the <code>autostop</code> option, you need to understand the way photons are shot from light sources. 
 Photons are shot in a spiral pattern with uniform angular density. Imagine a sphere with a spiral starting at one of 
 the poles and spiraling out in ever-increasing circles to the equator. Two angles are involved here. The first, phi, 
 is the how far progress has been made in the current circle of the spiral. The second, theta, is how far we are from 
 the pole to the equator. Now, imagine this sphere centered at the light source with the pole where the spiral starts 
 pointed towards the center of the object receiving photons. Now, photons are shot out of the light in this spiral 
 pattern. 
</p>

<p>
  Normally, POV does not stop shooting photons until the target object's entire bounding box has been thoroughly 
 covered. Sometimes, however, an object is much smaller than its bounding box. At these times, we want to stop shooting 
 if we do a complete circle in the spiral without hitting the object. Unfortunately, some objects (such as copper 
 rings), have holes in the middle. Since we start shooting at the middle of the object, the photons just go through the 
 hole in the middle, thus fooling the system into thinking that it is done. To avoid this, the <code>autostop</code> 
 keyword lets you specify how far the system must go before this auto-stopping feature kicks in. The value specified is 
 a fraction of the object's bounding box. Valid values are 0.0 through 1.0 (0% through 100%). POV will continue to 
 shoot photons until the spiral has exceeded this value or the bounding box is completely covered. If a complete circle 
 of photons fails to hit the target object after the spiral has passed the autostop threshold, POV will then stop 
 shooting photons. 
</p>

<p>
  The <code>autostop</code> feature will also not kick in until at least one photon has hit the object. This allows 
 you to use <code>autostop 0</code> even with objects that have holes in the middle. 
</p>

<p class="Note">
  <strong>Note:</strong>If the light source is within the object's bounding box, the photons are shot in 
 all directions from the light source.

<h5><a name="s03_06_03_05_02">3.6.3.5.2 </a>Adaptive Search Radius</h5>

<p>
  Unless photons are interacting with media, POV-Ray uses an adaptive search radius while gathering photons. If the 
 minimum number of photons is not found in the original search radius, the radius is expanded and searched again. Using 
 this adaptive search radius can both decrease the amount of time it takes to render the image, and sharpen the borders 
 in the caustic patterns.<a name="s03_06_03_05_02_i1"><a name="expand_thresholds"></a> 
</p>

<p>
  Sometimes this adaptive search technique can create unwanted artefacts at borders. To remove these artefacts, a few 
 thresholds are used, which can be specified by <code>expand_thresholds</code>. For example, if expanding the radius 
 increases the estimated density of photons by too much (threshold is percent_increase, default is 20%, or 0.2), the 
 expanded search is discarded and the old search is used instead. However, if too few photons are gathered in the 
 expanded search (<code>expand_min</code>, default is 40), the new search will be used always, even if it means more 
 than a 20% increase in photon density. 
</p>

<a name="s03_06_03_05_03_i1"><a name="photons, dispersion"></a><a name="s03_06_03_05_03_i2">
<p>
  When dispersion is specified for interior of a transparent object, photons will make use of that and show 
 &quot;colored&quot; caustics. 
</p>

<h5><a name="s03_06_03_05_04">3.6.3.5.4 </a>Saving and Loading Photon Maps</h5>

<p>
  It is possible to save and load photon maps to speed up rendering. The photon map itself is view-independent, so if 
 you want to animate a scene that contains photons and you know the photon map will not change during the animation, 
 you can save it on the first frame and then load it for all subsequent frames. 
</p>

<p>
  To save the photon map, put the line 
</p>

<pre>
 save_file &quot;myfile.ph&quot;
</pre>

<p>
  into the <code>photons { }</code> block inside the <code>global_settings</code> section. 
</p>

<p>
  Loading the photon map is the same, but with <code>load_file</code> instead of <code>save_file</code>. You cannot 
 both load and save a photon map in the POV file. If you load the photon map, it will load all of the photons. No 
 photons will be shot if the map is loaded from a file. All other options (such as gather radius) must still be 
 specified in the POV scene file and are not loaded with the photon map. 
</p>

<p>
  When can you safely re-use a saved photon map? 
</p>

<ul>
 
 <li>
   Moving the camera is <em>always</em> safe. 
 </li>

 <li>
   Moving lights that do not cast photons is <em>always</em> safe. 
 </li>

 <li>
   Moving objects that do not have photons shot at them, that do not receive photons, and would not receive photons 
  in the new location is <em>always</em> safe. 
 </li>

 <li>
   Moving an object that recieves photons to a new location where it does not receive photons is <em>sometimes</em> 
  safe. 
 </li>

 <li>
   Moving an object to a location where it recieves photons is <em>not</em> safe 
 </li>

 <li>
   Moving an object that has photons shot at it is <em>not</em> safe 
 </li>

 <li>
   Moving a light that casts photons is <em>not</em> safe. 
 </li>

 <li>
   Changing the texture of an object that recieves photons is safe. 
 </li>

 <li>
   Changing the texture of an object that has photons shot at it produces results that are not realistic, but can be 
  useful sometimes. 
 </li>

</ul>

<p>
  In general, changes to the scene geometry require photons to be re-shot. Changing the camera parameters or changing 
 the image resolution does not.
