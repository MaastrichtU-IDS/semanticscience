executable (binary) files, scene files, documentation files, help files, 
bitmaps and other POV-Ray files contained in official Company archives, 
whether in full or any part thereof, and are herein referred to as the 
&quot;Software&quot;. The Company reserves the right to revise these rules in future 
versions and to make additional rules to address new circumstances at any 
time. Such rules, when made, will be posted in a revised license file, the 
latest version of which is available from the Company website at

<h4>USAGE PROVISIONS</h4>

<p>
Subject to the terms and conditions of this agreement, permission is granted 
to the User to use the Software and its associated files to create and render
images. The creator of a scene file retains all rights to any scene files
they create, and any images generated by the Software from them. Subject to
the other terms of this license, the User is permitted to use the Software in
a profit-making enterprise, provided such profit arises primarily from use of

and include files distributed in the INCLUDE and SCENES\INCDEMO sub-
directories of the Software in their own scenes. Such permission does not
extend to any other files in the SCENES directory or its sub-directories. The
SCENES files are for the User's enjoyment and education but may not be the
basis of any derivative works unless the file in question explicitly grants
permission to do such.

<p>
This licence does not grant any right of re-distribution or use in any manner
other than the above. The Company has separate license documents that apply
to other uses (such as re-distribution via the internet or on CD); please
