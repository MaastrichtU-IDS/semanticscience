<p>
  The reference section describes all command line switches and INI file keywords that are used to set the options of 
 POV-Ray. It is supposed to be used as a reference for looking up things. It does not contain detailed explanations on 
 how scenes are written or how POV-Ray is used. It just explains all features, their syntax, applications, limits, 
 drawbacks, etc. 
</p>

<p>
  Options may be specified by switches or INI-style options. Almost all INI-style options have equivalent <code> +</code>/ 
 <code>-</code> switches and most switches have equivalent INI-style option. The following sections give a detailed 
 description of each POV-Ray option. It includes both the INI-style settings and the <code> +</code>/ <code>-</code> 
 switches.

  Internal animation loop, automatic output file name numbering and the ability to shell out to the operating system 
 to external utilities which can assemble individual frames into an animation, greatly improved the animation 
 capability. The internal animation loop is simple yet flexible. You may still use external programs or batch files to 
 create animations without the internal loop.

  The <code>Clock=</code><em>n.n</em> option or the <code> +K</code><em>n.n</em> switch may be used to pass a single 
 float value to the program for basic animation. The value is stored in the float identifier <code>clock</code>. If an 
 object had a <code>rotate &lt;0,clock,0&gt;</code> attached then you could rotate the object by different amounts over 
 different frames by setting <code> +K10.0</code>,<code>+K20.0</code>... etc. on successive renderings. It is up to the 
 user to repeatedly invoke POV-Ray with a different <code> Clock</code> value and a different <code> Output_File_Name</code> 
 for each frame.

<p>
  The internal animation loop relieves the user of the task of generating complicated sets of batch files to invoke 
 POV-Ray multiple times with different settings. While the multitude of options may look intimidating, the clever set 
 of default values means that you will probably only need to specify the <code>Final_Frame</code>=<em>n</em> or the <code>+KFF</code><em>n</em> 
 option to specify the number of frames. All other values may remain at their defaults. 
</p>

<p>
  Any <code>Final_Frame</code> setting other than -1 will trigger POV-Ray's internal animation loop. For example <code> 
 Final_Frame=10</code> or <code>+KFF10</code> causes POV-Ray to render your scene 10 times. If you specified <code><a href="s_95.html#s03_01_02_04_02">Output_File_Name</a>=file.tga</code> 
 then each frame would be output as <code>file01.tga</code>, <code>file02.tga</code>, <code>file03.tga</code> etc. The 
 number of zero-padded digits in the file name depends upon the final frame number. For example <code>+KFF100</code> 
 would generate <code>file001.tga</code> through <code>file100.tga</code>. The frame number may encroach upon the file 
 name. On MS-DOS with an eight character limit, <code>myscene.pov</code> would render to <code>mysce001.tga</code> 
 through <code>mysce100.tga</code>. 
</p>

<p>
  The default <code>Initial_Frame=1</code> will probably never have to be changed. You would only change it if you 
 were assembling a long animation sequence in pieces. One scene might run from frame 1 to 50 and the next from 51 to 
 100. The <code>Initial_Frame</code>=<em>n</em> or <code> +KFI</code><em>n</em> option is for this purpose. 
</p>

<p class="Note">
  <strong>Note:</strong> if you wish to render a subset of frames such as 30 through 40 out of a 1 to 
 100 animation, you should not change <code>Initial_Frame</code> or <code>Final_Frame</code>. Instead you should use 
 the subset commands described in section &quot;<a href="s_95.html#s03_01_02_01_03">Subsets of Animation Frames</a>&quot;. 
 
</p>

<p>
  Unlike some animation packages, the action in POV-Ray animated scenes does not depend upon the integer frame 
 numbers. Rather you should design your scenes based upon the float identifier <code><a href="s_97.html#s03_02_01_03_06">clock</a></code>. 
 By default, the clock value is 0.0 for the initial frame and 1.0 for the final frame. All other frames are 
 interpolated between these values. For example if your object is supposed to rotate one full turn over the course of 
 the animation, you could specify <code>rotate 360*clock*y</code>. Then as clock runs from 0.0 to 1.0, the object 
 rotates about the y-axis from 0 to 360 degrees. 
</p>

<p>
  The major advantage of this system is that you can render a 10 frame animation or a 100 frame or 500 frame or 329 
 frame animation yet you still get one full 360 degree rotation. Test renders of a few frames work exactly like final 
 renders of many frames. 
</p>

<p>
  In effect you define the motion over a continuous float valued parameter (the clock) and you take discrete samples 
 at some fixed intervals (the frames). If you take a movie or video tape of a real scene it works the same way. An 
 object's actual motion depends only on time. It does not depend on the frame rate of your camera. 
</p>

<p>
  Many users have already created scenes for POV-Ray 2 that expect clock values over a range other than the default 
 0.0 to 1.0. For this reason we provide the <code>Initial_Clock</code>=<em>n.n</em> or <code>+KI</code><em>n.n</em> and <code>Final_Clock</code>=<em>n.n</em> 
 or <code>+KF</code><em>n.n</em> options. For example to run the clock from 25.0 to 75.0 you would specify <code>Initial_Clock=25.0</code> 
 and <code>Final_Clock=75.0</code>. Then the clock would be set to 25.0 for the initial frame and 75.0 for the final 
 frame. In-between frames would have clock values interpolated from 25.0 through 75.0 proportionally. 
</p>

<p>
  Users who are accustomed to using frame numbers rather than clock values could specify <code> Initial_Clock=1.0</code> 
 and <code>Final_Clock=10.0</code> and <code>Frame_Final=10</code> for a 10 frame animation. 
</p>

<p>
  For new scenes, we recommend you do not change the <code> Initial_Clock</code> or <code> Final_Clock</code> from 
 their default 0.0 to 1.0 values. If you want the clock to vary over a different range than the default 0.0 to 1.0, we 
 recommend you handle this inside your scene file as follows... 
</p>

<pre>
  #declare Start    = 25.0;
  #declare End      = 75.0;
  #declare My_Clock = Start+(End-Start)*clock;
</pre>

<p>
  Then use <code>My_Clock</code> in the scene description. This keeps the critical values 25.0 and 75.0 in your .pov 
 file. 
</p>

<p>
  When creating a long animation, it may be handy to render only a portion of the animation to see what it looks 
 like. Suppose you have 100 frames but only want to render frames 30 through 40. If you set <code>Initial_Frame=30</code> 
 and <code>Final_Frame=40</code> then the clock would vary from 0.0 to 1.0 from frames 30 through 40 rather than 0.30 
 through 0.40 as it should. Therefore you should leave <code> Initial_Frame=1</code> and <code>Final_Frame=100</code> 
 and use <code>Subset_Start_Frame=30</code> and <code>Subset_End_Frame=40</code> to selectively render part of the 
 scene. POV-Ray will then properly compute the clock values. 
</p>

<p>
  Usually you will specify the subset using the actual integer frame numbers however an alternate form of the subset 
 commands takes a float value in the range <em>0.0 &lt;=n.nnn &lt;=1.0</em> which is interpreted as a fraction of the 
 whole animation. For example, <code> Subset_Start_Frame=0.333</code> and <code>Subset_End_Frame=0.667</code> would 
 render the middle 1/3rd of a sequence regardless of the number of frames.

<p>
  Many computer animation sequences are designed to be run in a continuous loop. Suppose you have an object that 
 rotates exactly 360 degrees over the course of your animation and you did <code>rotate 360*clock*y</code> to do so. 
 Both the first and last frames would be identical. Upon playback there would be a brief one frame jerkiness. To 
 eliminate this problem you need to adjust the clock so that the last frame does not match the first. For example a ten 
 frame cyclic animation should not use clock 0.0 to 1.0. It should run from 0.0 to 0.9 in 0.1 increments. However if 
 you change to 20 frames it should run from 0.0 to 0.95 in 0.05 increments. This complicates things because you would 
 have to change the final clock value every time you changed <code>Final_Frame</code>. Setting <code>Cyclic_Animation=on</code> 
 or using <code>+KC</code> will cause POV-Ray to automatically adjust the final clock value for cyclic animation 
 regardless of how many total frames. The default value for this setting is off.

<p>
  Field rendering is sometimes used for animations when the animation is being output for television. TVs only 
 display alternate scan lines on each vertical refresh. When each frame is being displayed the fields are interlaced to 
 give the impression of a higher resolution image. The even scan lines make up the even field, and are drawn first 
 (i.e. scan lines 0, 2, 4, etc.), followed by the odd field, made up of the odd numbered scan lines are drawn 
 afterwards. If objects in an animation are moving quickly, their position can change noticeably from one field to the 
 next. As a result, it may be desirable in these cases to have POV-Ray render alternate fields at the actual field rate 
 (which is twice the frame rate), rather than rendering full frames at the normal frame rate. This would save a great 
 deal of time compared to rendering the entire animation at twice the frame rate, and then only using half of each 
 frame. 
</p>

<p>
  By default, field rendering is not used. Setting <code> Field_Render=on</code> or using <code> +UF</code> will 
 cause alternate frames in an animation to be only the even or odd fields of an animation. By default, the first frame 
 is the even field, followed by the odd field. You can have POV-Ray render the odd field first by specifying <code> 
 Odd_Field=on</code>, or by using the <code> +UO</code> switch.

<p>
  When doing test rendering it is often convenient to define a small, rectangular sub-section of the whole screen so 
 you can quickly check out one area of the image. The <code>Start_Row</code>, <code>End_Row</code>, <code> Start_Column</code> 
 and <code>End_Column</code> options allow you to define the subset area to be rendered. The default values are the 
 full size of the image from (1,1) which is the upper left to (w,h) on the lower right where w and h are the <code>Width=</code><em>n</em> 
 and <code> Height=</code><em>n</em> values you have set. 
</p>

<p class="Note">
  <strong>Note:</strong> if the number specified is greater than 1 then it is interpreted as an absolute 
 row or column number in pixels. If it is a decimal value between 0.0 and 1.0 then it is interpreted as a percent of 
 the total width or height of the image. 
</p>

<p>
  For example: <code> Start_Row=0.75</code> and <code> Start_Column=0.75</code> starts on a row 75% down from the top 
 at a column 75% from the left. Thus it renders only the lower-right 25% of the image regardless of the specified width 
 and height. 
</p>

<p>
  The <code>+SR</code>, <code>+ER</code>, <code> +SC</code> and <code> +EC</code> switches work in the same way as 
 the corresponding INI-style settings for both absolute settings or percentages. Early versions of POV-Ray allowed only 
 start and end rows to be specified with <code> +S</code><em>n</em> and <code> +E</code><em>n</em> so they are still 
 supported in addition to <code> +SR</code> and <code>+ER</code>. 
</p>

<p>
  When rendering a subset of *columns* (<code>+sc/+ec</code>) POV-Ray generates a full width image and fills the not 
 rendered columns with black pixels. This should not be a problem for any image reading program no matter what file 
 format is used. 
</p>

<p>
  when rendering a subset of *rows* (<code>+sr/+er</code>) POV-Ray writes the full height into the image file header 
 and only writed those lines into the image that are rendered. This can cause problems with image reading programs that 
 are not checking the file while reading and just read over the end. 
</p>

<p>
  if POV-Ray wrote the actual height of the partial image into the image header there would be no way to continue the 
 trace in a later run.

<p>
  On some operating systems once you start a rendering you must let it finish. The <code>Test_Abort=on</code> option 
 or <code>+X</code> switch causes POV-Ray to test the keyboard for keypress. If you have pressed a key, it will 
 generate a controlled user abort. Files will be flushed and closed but only data through the last full row of pixels 
 is saved. POV-Ray exits with an error code 2 (normally POV-Ray returns 0 for a successful run or 1 for a fatal error). 
</p>

<p>
  When this option is on, the keyboard is polled on every line while parsing the scene file and on every pixel while 
 rendering. Because polling the keyboard can slow down a rendering, the <code> Test_Abort_Count=</code><em>n</em> 
 option or <code>+X</code><em>n</em> switch causes the test to be performed only every <em>n</em> pixels rendered or 
 scene lines parsed.

  If you abort a render while it is in progress or if you used the <code><a href="s_95.html#s03_01_02_02_02">End_Row</a></code> 
 option to end the render prematurely, you can use <code>Continue_Trace=on</code> or <code>+C</code> option to continue 
 the render later at the point where you left off. This option reads in the previously generated output file, displays 
 the partial image rendered so far, then proceeds with the ray-tracing. This option cannot be used if file output is 
 disabled with <code><a href="s_95.html#s03_01_02_04">Output_to_file</a>=off</code> or <code>-F</code>. 
</p>

<p>
  The <code>Continue_Trace</code> option may not work if the <code>Start_Row</code> option has been set to anything 
 but the top of the file, depending on the output format being used. Also POV-Ray cannot continue the file once it has 
 been opened and saved again by any program 
</p>

<p>
  POV-Ray tries to figure out where to resume an interrupted trace by reading any previously generated data in the 
 specified output file. All file formats contain the image size, so this will override any image size settings 
 specified. Some file formats (namely TGA and PNG) also store information about where the file started (i. e. <code> +SC</code><em>n</em> 
 and <code> +SR</code><em>n</em> options), alpha output <code>+UA</code>, and bit-depth <code>+FN</code><em>n</em>, 
 which will override these settings. It is up to the user to make sure that all other options are set the same as the 
 original render. 
</p>

<p>
  The <code>Create_Ini</code> option or <code>+GI</code> switch provides an easy way to create an INI file with all 
 of the rendering options, so you can re-run files with the same options, or ensure you have all the same options when 
 resuming. This option creates an INI file with every option set at the value used for that rendering. This includes 
 default values which you have not specified. For example if you run POV-Ray with... 
</p>

<pre>
 POVRAY +Isimple.pov MYOPTS +GIrerun.ini MOREOPTS
</pre>

<p>
  POV-Ray will create a file called <code>rerun.ini</code> with all of the options used to generate this scene. The 
 file is not written until all options have been processed. This means that in the above example, the file will include 
 options from both <code>myopts.ini</code> and <code> moreopts.ini</code> despite the fact that the <code>+GI</code> 
 switch is specified between them. You may now re-run the scene with... 
</p>

<pre>
 POVRAY RERUN
</pre>

<p>
  or resume an interrupted trace with 
</p>

<pre>
 POVRAY RERUN +C
</pre>

<p>
  If you add other switches with the <code>rerun.ini</code> reference, they will be included in future re-runs 
 because the file is re-written every time you use it. 
</p>

<p>
  The <code>Create_Ini</code> option is also useful for documenting how a scene was rendered. If you render <code> 
 waycool.pov</code> with <code> Create_Ini=on</code> then it will create a file <code>waycool.ini</code> that you could 
 distribute along with your scene file so other users can exactly re-create your image.

<p>
  The <code>Display=on</code> or <code>+D</code> switch will turn on the graphics display of the image while it is 
 being rendered. Even on some non-graphics systems, POV-Ray may display an 80 by 24 character <em> &quot;ASCII-Art&quot;</em> 
 version of your image. Where available, the display may be full, 24-bit true color. Setting <code>Display=off</code> 
 or using the <code>-D</code> switch will turn off the graphics display which is the default. 
</p>

<p>
  On the Windows platform, the default is <code>Display=on</code>. Turning display off does not, of course, turn off 
 the actual video display. Instead, POV-Ray will not open the output window that it normally shows a render in. 
</p>

<p>
  The <code>Video_Mode=</code><em>x</em> option sets the display mode or hardware type chosen where <em>x</em> is a 
 single digit or letter that is machine dependent. Generally <code>Video_Mode=0</code> means the default or an 
 auto-detected setting should be used. When using switches, this character immediately follows the switch. For example 
 the <code>+D0</code> switch will turn on the graphics display in the default mode. 
</p>

<p>
  The <code> Palette=</code><em>y</em> option selects the palette to be used. Typically the single character 
 parameter <em>y</em> is a digit which selects one of several fixed palettes or a letter such <code>G</code> for gray 
 scale, <code> H</code> for 15-bit or 16-bit high color or <code> T</code> for 24-bit true color. When using switches, 
 this character is the 2nd character after the switch. For example the <code>+D0T</code> switch will turn on the 
 graphics display in the default mode with a true color palette. The <code> Display_Gamma=</code><em>n.n</em> setting 
 is not available as a command-line switch. 
</p>

<p>
  The <code> Display_Gamma</code> setting overcomes the problem of images (whether ray-traced or not) having 
 different brightness when being displayed on different monitors, different video cards, and under different operating 
 systems. 
</p>

<p class="Note">
  <strong>Note:</strong> the <code>Display_Gamma</code> is a setting based on your computer's display 
 hardware, and should be set correctly once and not changed. 
</p>

<p>
  The <code> Display_Gamma</code> INI setting works in conjunction with the new <code> assumed_gamma</code> global 
 setting to ensure that POV scenes and the images they create look the same on all systems. See section &quot;<a href="s_102.html#s03_03_03_03">Assumed_Gamma</a>&quot; 
 which describes the <code> assumed_gamma</code> global setting and describes gamma more thoroughly. 
</p>

<p>
  While the <code> Display_Gamma</code> can be different for each system, there are a few general rules that can be 
 used for setting <code> Display_Gamma</code> if you do not know it exactly. If the <code> Display_Gamma</code> keyword 
 does not appear in the INI file, POV-Ray assumes that the display gamma is 2.2. This is because most PC monitors have 
 a gamma value in the range 1.6 to 2.6 (newer models seem to have a lower gamma value). Mac has the ability to do gamma 
 correction inside the system software (based on a user setting in the gamma control panel). If the gamma control panel 
 is turned off, or is not available, the default Macintosh system gamma is 1.8. Many newer PC graphics cards can do 
 hardware gamma correction and should use the current Display_Gamma setting, usually 1.0. 
</p>

<h5><a name="s03_01_02_03_02">3.1.2.3.2 </a>Setting your Display Gamma</h5>
<a name="s03_01_02_03_02_i1"><a name="s03_01_02_03_02_i2">
<p>
  The following gamma test image can be used to help you set your <code>Display_Gamma</code> accurately. 
</p>

<p>
  Before viewing the gamma image darken the room and set the monitor brightness and contrast to maximum. While 
 viewing a black screen, lower the brightness gradually until the &quot;background&quot; is no longer noticeable (ie 
 when it just fades from view). This may be difficult on monitors that use overscanning, unless you change the viewable 
 area settings.<a name="s03_01_02_03_02_i3"> 
</p>

<p>
  <br><center><img alt="Display gamma test image." src="images/reference/gamma.png"></center> 
</p>

<p>
  Now, lower the contrast until the alternating white and black bars on the left edge of each column are equal in 
 width. This is trying to get a 50% gray by using half white and half black. If this is not possible, choose a contrast 
 setting which is about in the middle. While viewing the image from a distance, or with squinted eyes, one of the 
 numbered &quot;swatches&quot; will best match the gray value approximated by the white and black bars. The number in 
 this &quot;swatch&quot; is your display's actual gamma value. 
</p>

<p>
  Normal display gamma values are in the range 2.0 to 2.6. If your monitor is usually used in a dim environment, we 
 often use a gamma value that is 15% - 25% lower than the actual display gamma to give the images more contrast. Some 
 systems, such as Macs and SGIs, already do gamma correction, so they may have display gammas of 1.0 or 1.8. 
</p>

<p>
  For scene files that do not contain an <code>assumed_gamma</code> global setting the INI file option <code>Display_Gamma</code> 
 will not have any affect on the preview output of POV-Ray or for most output file formats. However, the <code>Display_Gamma</code> 
 value is used when creating PNG format output files, and also when rendering the POV-Ray example files (because they 
 have an <code>assumed_gamma</code>), so it should still be correctly set for your system to ensure proper results.

<p>
  On some systems, when the image is complete, the graphics display is cleared and POV-Ray switches back into text 
 mode to print the final statistics and to exit. Normally when the graphics display is on, you want to look at the 
 image awhile before continuing. Using <code>Pause_When_Done=on</code> or <code>+P</code> causes POV-Ray to pause in 
 graphics mode until you press a key to continue. The default is not to pause (<code>-P</code>). 
</p>

<p>
  When the graphics display is not used, it is often desirable to monitor progress of the rendering. Using <code> 
 Verbose=on</code> or <code>+V</code> turns on verbose reporting of your rendering progress. This reports the number of 
 the line currently being rendered, the elapsed time for the current frame and other information. On some systems, this 
 textual information can conflict with the graphics display. You may need to turn this off when the display is on. The 
 default setting is off (<code>-V</code>). 
</p>

<p>
  The option <code>Draw_Vistas=on</code> or <code>+UD</code> was originally a debugging help for POV-Ray's vista 
 buffer feature but it was such fun we decided to keep it. Vista buffering is a spatial sub-division method that 
 projects the 2-D extents of bounding boxes onto the viewing window. POV-Ray tests the 2-D x, y pixel location against 
 these rectangular areas to determine quickly which objects, if any, the viewing ray will hit. This option shows you 
 the 2-D rectangles used. The default setting is off (<code>-UD</code>) because the drawing of the rectangles can take 
 considerable time on complex scenes and it serves no critical purpose. See section &quot;<a href="s_95.html#s03_01_02_08_02">Automatic 
 Bounding Control</a>&quot; for more details.

<p>
  Typically, while you are developing a scene, you will do many low resolution test renders to see if objects are 
 placed properly. Often this low resolution version does not give you sufficient detail and you have to render the 
 scene again at a higher resolution. A feature called <em> &quot;mosaic preview&quot;</em> solves this problem by 
 automatically rendering your image in several passes. 
</p>

<p>
  The early passes paint a rough overview of the entire image using large blocks of pixels that look like mosaic 
 tiles. The image is then refined using higher resolutions on subsequent passes. This display method very quickly 
 displays the entire image at a low resolution, letting you look for any major problems with the scene. As it refines 
 the image, you can concentrate on more details, like shadows and textures. You do not have to wait for a full 
 resolution render to find problems, since you can interrupt the rendering early and fix the scene, or if things look 
 good, you can let it continue and render the scene at high quality and resolution. 
</p>

<p>
  To use this feature you should first select a <code> Width</code> and <code> Height</code> value that is the 
 highest resolution you will need. Mosaic preview is enabled by specifying how big the mosaic blocks will be on the 
 first pass using <code> Preview_Start_Size=</code><em>n</em> or <code> +SP</code><em>n</em>. The value n should be a 
 number greater than zero that is a power of two (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, etc.) If it is not a power of two, the nearest 
 power of two less than n is substituted. This sets the size of the squares, measured in pixels. A value of 16 will 
 draw every 16th pixel as a 16*16 pixel square on the first pass. Subsequent passes will use half the previous value 
 (such as 8*8, 4*4 and so on.) 
</p>

<p>
  The process continues until it reaches 1*1 pixels or until it reaches the size you set with <code> Preview_End_Size=</code><em>n</em> 
 or <code> +EP</code><em>n</em>. Again the value n should be a number greater than zero that is a power of two and less 
 than or equal to <code> Preview_Start_Size</code>. If it is not a power of two, the nearest power of two less than n 
 is substituted. The default ending value is 1. If you set <code>Preview_End_Size</code> to a value greater than 1 the 
 mosaic passes will end before reaching 1*1, but POV-Ray will always finish with a 1*1. For example, if you want a 
 single 8*8 mosaic pass before rendering the final image, set <code> Preview_Start_Size=8</code> and <code> 
 Preview_End_Size=8</code>. 
</p>

<p>
  No file output is performed until the final 1*1 pass is reached. Although the preliminary passes render only as 
 many pixels as needed, the 1*1 pass re-renders every pixel so that anti-aliasing and file output streams work 
 properly. This makes the scene take up to 25% longer than the regular 1*1 pass to render, so it is suggested that 
 mosaic preview not be used for final rendering. Also, the lack of file output until the final pass means that 
 renderings which are interrupted before the 1*1 pass can not be resumed without starting over from the beginning.

<p class="Note">
  <strong>Note:</strong> the obsolete <code>+FD</code> dump format and <code>+FR</code> raw format have 
 been dropped because they were rarely used and no longer necessary. PPM, PNG, and system specific formats have been 
 added. PPM format images are uncompressed, and have a simple text header, which makes it a widely portable image 
 format. PNG is an image format designed not only to replace GIF, but to improve on its shortcomings. PNG offers the 
 highest compression available without loss for high quality applications, such as ray-tracing. The system specific 
 format depends on the platform used and is covered in the appropriate system specific documentation. 
</p>

<p>
  Most of these formats output 24 bits per pixel with 8 bits for each of red, green and blue data. PNG and PPM allow 
 you to optionally specify the output bit depth from 5 to 16 bits for each of the red, green, and blue colors, giving 
 from 15 to 48 bits of color information per pixel. The default output depth for all formats is 8 bits/color (16 
 million possible colors), but this may be changed for PNG and PPM format files by setting <code>Bits_Per_Color=</code><em>n</em> 
 or by specifying <code>+FN</code><em>n</em> or <code>+FP</code><em>n</em>, where n is the desired bit depth. 
</p>

<p>
  Specifying a smaller color depth like 5 bits/color (32768 colors) may be enough for people with 8- or 16-bit (256 
 or 65536 color) displays, and will improve compression of the PNG file. Higher bit depths like 10 or 12 may be useful 
 for video or publishing applications, and 16 bits/color is good for grayscale height field output (See section &quot;<a href="s_105.html#s03_04_01_05">Height 
 Field</a>&quot; for details on height fields). 
</p>

<p>
  Targa format also allows 8 bits of alpha transparency data to be output, while PNG format allows 5 to 16 bits of 
 alpha transparency data, depending on the color bit depth as specified above. You may turn this option on with <code> 
 Output_Alpha=on</code> or <code>+UA</code>. The default is off or <code> -UA</code>. 
</p>

<p>
  The alpha channel stores a transparency value for each pixel, just like there is also stored a value for red green 
 and blue light for each pixel. In POV-Ray, when the alpha channel is turned on, all areas of the image where the 
 background is partly or fully visible will be partly or fully transparent. Refractions of the background will also be 
 transparent, but not reflections. Also anti-aliasing is taken into account 
</p>

<p>
  The philosophy of the alpha channel feature in POV-Ray is that the background color should not be present in the 
 color of the image when the alpha channel is used. Instead, the amount of visible background is kept in the alpha and 
 *only* in the alpha channel. That ensures that images look correct when viewed with the alpha channel. 
</p>

<p>
  See section &quot;<a href="s_115.html#s03_05_01_05_03">Using the Alpha Channel</a>&quot; for further details on 
 using transparency in imagemaps in your scene. 
</p>

<p>
  In addition to support for variable bit-depths, alpha channel, and grayscale formats, PNG files also store the <code> 
 Display_Gamma</code> value so the image displays properly on all systems (see section &quot;<a href="s_95.html#s03_01_02_03_01">Display 
 Hardware Settings</a>&quot;). The <code>hf_gray_16</code> global setting, as described in section &quot;<a href="s_102.html#s03_03_03_04">HF_Gray_16</a>&quot; 
 will also affect the type of data written to the output file.

<p>
  The default output filename is created from the scene name and need not be specified. The scene name is the input 
 name with all drive, path, and extension information stripped. For example if the input file name is <code> 
 c:\povray3\mystuff\myfile.pov</code> the scene name is <code> myfile</code>. The proper extension is appended to the 
 scene name based on the file type. For example <code>myfile.tga</code> or <code> myfile.png</code> might be used. 
</p>

<p>
  You may override the default output name using <code> Output_File_Name=</code><em>file</em> or <code> +O</code><em>file</em>. 
 For example: 
</p>

<pre>
 Input_File_Name=myinput.pov
 Output_File_Name=myoutput.tga
</pre>

<p>
  If an output file name of &quot;-&quot; is specified (a single minus sign), then the image will be written to 
 standard output, usually the screen. The output can then be piped into another program or to a GUI if desired.

</p>

<pre>
 Input_File_Name=myscene.pov

<h5><a name="s03_01_02_04_04">3.1.2.4.4 </a>CPU Utilization Histogram</h5>

<p>
  The CPU utilization histogram is a way of finding out where POV-Ray is spending its rendering time, as well as an 
 interesting way of generating heightfields. The histogram splits up the screen into a rectangular grid of blocks. As 
 POV-Ray renders the image, it calculates the amount of time it spends rendering each pixel and then adds this time to 
 the total rendering time for each grid block. When the rendering is complete, the histogram is a file which represents 
 how much time was spent computing the pixels in each grid block. 
</p>

<p>
  Not all versions of POV-Ray allow the creation of histograms. The histogram output is dependent on the file type 
 and the system that POV-Ray is being run on.

<p>
  The Targa and PPM format files are in the POV heightfield format (see &quot;<a href="s_105.html#s03_04_01_05">Height 
 Field</a>&quot;), so the histogram information is stored in both the red and green parts of the image, which makes it 
 unsuitable for viewing. When used as a height field, lower values indicate less time spent calculating the pixels in 
 that block, while higher indicate more time spent in that block. 
</p>

<p>
  PNG format images are stored as grayscale images and are useful for both viewing the histogram data as well as for 
 use as a heightfield. In PNG files, the darker (lower) areas indicate less time spent in that grid block, while the 
 brighter (higher) areas indicate more time spent in that grid block.

<p>
  The histogram grid size gives the number of times the image is split up in both the horizontal and vertical 
 directions. For example 
</p>

<pre>
 povray +Isample +W640 +H480 +HTN +HS160.120 +HNhistogram.png
</pre>

<p>
  will split the image into 160*120 grid blocks, each of size 4*4 pixels, and output a PNG file, suitable for viewing 
 or for use as a heightfield. Smaller numbers for the grid size mean more pixels are put into the same grid block. With 
 CSV output, the number of values output is the same as the number of grid blocks specified. For the other formats the 
 image size is identical to the rendered image rather than the specified grid size, to allow easy comparison between 
 the histogram and the rendered image. If the histogram grid size is not specified, it will default to the same size as 
 the image, so there will be one grid block per pixel. 
</p>

<p class="Note">
  <strong>Note:</strong> on systems that do task-switching or multi-tasking the histogram may not 
 exactly represent the amount of time POV-Ray spent in a given grid block since the histogram is based on real time 
 rather than CPU time. As a result, time may be spent for operating system overhead or on other tasks running at the 
 same time. This will cause the histogram to have speckling, noise or large spikes. This can be reduced by decreasing 
 the grid size so that more pixels are averaged into a given grid block.

 +Ic:\povray3\mystuff\myfile.pov</code> is allowed for example). In addition to specifying the input file name this 
 also establishes the <em>scene name</em>. 
</p>

<p>
  The scene name is the input name with drive, path and extension stripped. In the above example the scene name is <code>myfile</code>. 
 This name is used to create a default output file name and it is referenced other places. 
</p>

<p class="Note">
  <strong>Note:</strong> as per version 3.5 you can now specify a POV file on the command-line without 
 the use of the +i switch (i.e. it works the same way as specifying an INI file without a switch), the POV file then 
 should be the last on the commandline. 
</p>

<p>
  If you use &quot;-&quot; as the input file name the input will be read from standard input. Thus you can pipe a 
 scene created by a program to POV-Ray and render it without having a scene file. 
</p>

<p>
  Under MS-DOS you can try this feature by typing.

  POV-Ray looks for files in the current directory. If it does not find a file it needs it looks in various other 
 library directories which you specify. POV-Ray does not search your operating system path. It only searches the 
 current directory and directories which you specify with this option. For example the standard include files are 
 usually kept in one special directory. You tell POV-Ray to look there with... 
</p>

<pre>
 Library_Path=c:\povray3\include
</pre>

<p>
  You must not specify any final path separators (&quot;\&quot; or &quot;/&quot;) at the end. 
</p>

<p>
  Multiple uses of this option switch do not override previous settings. Up to twenty unique paths may be specified. 
 If you specify the exact same path twice it is only counted once. The current directory will be searched first 
 followed by the indicated library directories in the order in which you specified them.

<p>
  As POV-Ray has evolved from version 1.0 through to today we have made every effort to maintain some amount of 
 backwards compatibility with earlier versions. Some old or obsolete features can be handled directly without any 
 special consideration by the user. Some old or obsolete features can no longer be handled at all. However <em>some</em> 
 old features can still be used if you warn POV-Ray that this is an older scene. In the POV-Ray scene language you can 
 use the <code>#version</code> directive to switch version compatibility to different settings. See section &quot;<a href="s_98.html#s03_02_02_05">The 
 #version Directive</a>&quot; for more details about the language version directive. Additionally you may use the <code>Version=</code><em>n.n</em> 
 option or the <code>+MV</code><em>n.n</em> switch to establish the <em>initial</em> setting. For example one feature 
 introduced in 2.0 that was incompatible with any 1.0 scene files is the parsing of float expressions. Setting <code> 
 Version=1.0</code> or using <code>+MV1.0</code> turns off expression parsing as well as many warning messages so that 
 nearly all 1.0 files will still work. Naturally the default setting for this option is the current version number. 
</p>

<p class="Note">
  <strong>Note:</strong> some obsolete or re-designed features <em>are totally unavailable in the 
 current version of POV-Ray REGARDLES OF THE VERSION SETTING.</em> Details on these features are noted throughout this

<p class="Note">
  <strong>Note:</strong> no <code>+</code> or <code>-</code> switches are available for these options. 
 They cannot be used from the command line. They may only be used from INI files. 
</p>

<p>
  POV-Ray offers you the opportunity to shell-out to the operating system at several key points to execute another 
 program or batch file. Usually this is used to manage files created by the internal animation loop however the shell 
 commands are available for any scene. The string <em>s</em> is a single line of text which is passed to the operating 
 system to execute a program. For example 
</p>

<pre>
 Post_Scene_Command=tga2gif -d -m myfile
</pre>

<p>
  would use the utility <code>tga2gif</code> with the <code>-D</code> and <code>-M</code> parameters to convert <code>myfile.tga</code> 
 to <code> myfile.gif</code> after the scene had finished rendering. 
</p>

<p class="Note">
  <strong>Note:</strong> individual platforms may provide means of preventing shell-outs from occurring. 
 For example, the Windows version provides a menu command to turn shell-outs off (which is the default setting for that 
 platform). The reason for this (along with file I/O restrictions) is to attempt to prevent untrusted INI files from 
 doing harm to your system. 
</p>

<h5><a name="s03_01_02_06_01">3.1.2.6.1 </a>String Substitution in Shell Commands</h5>

<p>
  It could get cumbersome to change the <code>Post_Scene_Command</code> every time you changed scene names. POV-Ray 
 can substitute various values into a command string for you. For example: 
</p>

<pre>
 Post_Scene_Command=tga2gif -d -m %s
</pre>

<p>
  POV-Ray will substitute the <code>%s</code> with the scene name in the command. The <em>scene name</em> is the <code>Input_File_Name</code> 
 or <code>+I</code> setting with any drive, directory and extension removed. For example: 
</p>

<pre>
 Input_File_Name=c:\povray3\scenes\waycool.pov
</pre>

<p>
  is stripped down to the scene name <code>waycool</code> which results in... 
</p>

<pre>
 Post_Scene_Command=tga2gif -d -m waycool
</pre>

<p>
  In an animation it may be necessary to have the exact output file name with the frame number included. The string <code>%o</code> 
 will substitute the output file name. Suppose you want to save your output files in a zip archive using the utility 
 program <code>pkzip</code>. You could do... 
</p>

<pre>
 Post_Frame_Command=pkzip -m %s %o
</pre>

<p>
  After rendering frame 12 of <code>myscene.pov</code> POV-Ray would shell to the operating system with 
</p>

<pre>
 pkzip -m myscene mysce012.tga
</pre>

<p>
  The <code>-M</code> switch in <code>pkzip</code> moves <code> mysce012.tga</code> to <code>myscene.zip</code> and 
 removes it from the directory. Note that <code>%o</code> includes frame numbers only when in an animation loop. During 
 the <code>Pre_Scene_Command</code> and <code> Post_Scene_Command</code> there is no frame number so the original, 
 unnumbered <code>Output_File_Name</code> is used. Any <code> User_Abort_Command</code> or <code>Fatal_Error_Command</code> 
 not inside the loop will similarly give an unnumbered <code>%o</code> substitution. 
</p>

<p>
  Here is the complete list of substitutions available for a command string.

 </li>

 <li>
   Open any text output streams and do Create_INI if any. 
 </li>

 <li>

 </li>

 <li>
   Loop through frames (or just do once on non-animation). 
  <ol type="a">
   
   <li>
     Execute Pre_Frame_Command if any. 
   </li>

   <li>
     Parse entire scene file, open output file and read settings, turn on display, render the frame, destroy all 
    objects, textures etc., close output file, close display. 
   </li>

   <li>
     Execute Post_Frame_Command if any. 
   </li>

   <li>
     Repeat above steps until all frames are done. 
   </li>

  </ol>
   
 </li>

 <li>
   Execute Post_Scene_Command if any. 
 </li>

 <li>
   Finish 
 </li>

</ol>

<p>
  If the user interrupts processing the <code>User_Abort_Command</code>, if any, is executed. User aborts can only 
 occur during the parsing and rendering parts of step (4b) above. If a fatal error occurs that POV-Ray notices the <code>Fatal_Error_Command</code>, 
 if any, is executed. Sometimes an unforeseen bug or memory error could cause a total crash of the program in which 
 case there is no chance to shell out. Fatal errors can occur just about anywhere including during the processing of 
 switches or INI files. If a fatal error occurs before POV-Ray has read the <code> Fatal_Error_Command</code> string 
 then obviously no shell can occur. 
</p>

<p class="Note">
  <strong>Note:</strong> the entire scene is re-parsed for every frame. Future versions of POV-Ray may 
 allow you to hold over parts of a scene from one frame to the next but for now it starts from scratch every time. 
</p>

<p class="Note">
  <strong>Note:</strong> that the <code>Pre_Frame_Command</code> occurs before the scene is parsed. You 
 might use this to call some custom scene generation utility before each frame. This utility could rewrite your <code> 
 .pov</code> or <code>.inc</code> files if needed. Perhaps you will want to generate new <code>.gif</code> or <code>.tga</code> 
 files for image maps or height fields on each frame.

<p>
  Most operating systems allow application programs to return an error code if something goes wrong. When POV-Ray 
 executes a shell command it can make use of this error code returned from the shell process and take some appropriate 
 action if the code is zero or non-zero. POV-Ray itself returns such codes. It returns 0 for success, 1 for fatal error 
 and 2 for user abort. 
</p>

<p>
  The actions are designated by a single letter in the different <code> ..._Return</code>=s options. The possible 
 actions are: 
</p>

<table width="100%">
 
 <tr>
  
  <td width="30%">
    <code>I</code>

<p>
  For example if your <code>Pre_Frame_Command</code> calls a program which generates your height field data and that 
 utility fails then it will return a non-zero code. We would probably want POV-Ray to abort as well. The option <code>Pre_Frame_Return=F</code> 
 will cause POV-Ray to do a fatal abort if the <code>Pre_Frame_Command</code> returns a non-zero code. 
</p>

<p>
  Sometimes a non-zero code from the external process is a good thing. Suppose you want to test if a frame has 
 already been rendered. You could use the <code>S</code> action to skip this frame if the file is already rendered. 
 Most utilities report an error if the file is not found. For example the command... 
</p>

<pre>
 pkzip -V myscene mysce012.tga
</pre>

<p>
  tells pkzip you want to view the catalog of <code>myscene.zip</code> for the file <code>mysce012.tga</code>. If the 
 file is not in the archive <code>pkzip</code> returns a non-zero code. 
</p>

<p>
  However we want to skip if the file is found. Therefore we need to reverse the action so it skips on zero and does 
 not skip on non-zero. To reverse the zero vs. non-zero triggering of an action precede it with a &quot;<code>-</code>&quot; 
 sign (note a &quot;<code>!</code>&quot; will also work since it is used in many programming languages as a negate 
 operator). 
</p>

<p>
  <code> Pre_Frame_Return=S</code> will skip if the code shows error (non-zero) and will proceed normally on no error 
 (zero). <code> Pre_Frame_Return=-S</code> will skip if there is no error (zero) and will proceed normally if there is 
 an error (non-zero). 
</p>

<p>
  The default for all shells is <code>I</code> which means that the return action is ignored no matter what. POV-Ray 
 simply proceeds with whatever it was doing before the shell command. The other actions depend upon the context. You 
 may want to refer back to the animation loop sequence chart in the previous section &quot;<a href="s_95.html#s03_01_02_06_02">Shell 
 Command Sequencing</a>&quot;. The action for each shell is as follows.

<a name="s03_01_02_07_i1">
<p>
  Text output is an important way that POV-Ray keeps you informed about what it is going to do, what it is doing and 
 what it did. The program splits its text messages into 7 separate streams. Some versions of POV-Ray color-codes the 
 various types of text. Some versions allow you to scroll back several pages of messages. All versions allow you to 
 turn some of these text streams off/on or to direct a copy of the text output to one or several files. This section 
 details the options which give you control over text output. 
</p>

<h5><a name="s03_01_02_07_01">3.1.2.7.1 </a>Text Streams</h5>
<a name="s03_01_02_07_01_i1"><a name="s03_01_02_07_01_i2"><a name="s03_01_02_07_01_i3">
<p>
  There are seven distinct text streams that POV-Ray uses for output. On some versions each stream is designated by a 
 particular color. Text from these streams are displayed whenever it is appropriate so there is often an intermixing of 
 the text. The distinction is only important if you choose to turn some of the streams off or to direct some of the 
 streams to text files. On some systems you may be able to review the streams separately in their own scroll-back 
 buffer. 
</p>

<p>
  Here is a description of each stream. 
</p>

<p>
  <strong> Banner:</strong> This stream displays the program's sign-on banner, copyright, contributor's list, and 
 some help screens. It cannot be turned off or directed to a file because most of this text is displayed before any 
 options or switches are read. Therefore you cannot use an option or switch to control it. There are switches which 
 display the help screens. They are covered in section &quot;<a href="s_95.html#s03_01_02_07_05">Help Screen Switches</a>&quot;. 
 
</p>

<p>
  <strong> Debug:</strong> This stream displays debugging messages. It was primarily designed for developers but this 
 and other streams may also be used by the user to display messages from within their scene files. See section 
 &quot;Text Message Streams&quot; for details on this feature. This stream may be turned off and/or directed to a text 
 file. 
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Fatal:</strong> This stream displays fatal error messages. After displaying this text, POV-Ray will 
 terminate. When the error is a scene parsing error, you may be shown several lines of scene text that leads up to the 
 error. This stream may be turned off and/or directed to a text file. 
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Render:</strong> This stream displays information about what options you have specified to render the 
 scene. It includes feedback on all of the major options such as scene name, resolution, animation settings, 
 anti-aliasing and others. This stream may be turned off and/or directed to a text file. 
</p>

<p>
  <strong> Statistics:</strong> This stream displays statistics after a frame is rendered. It includes information 
 about the number of rays traced, the length of time of the processing and other information. This stream may be turned 
 off and/or directed to a text file. 
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Status:</strong> This stream displays one-line status messages that explain what POV-Ray is doing at the 
 moment. On some systems this stream is displayed on a status line at the bottom of the screen. This stream cannot be 
 directed to a file because there is generally no need to. The text displayed by the <code> Verbose</code> option or <code>+V</code> 
 switch is output to this stream so that part of the status stream may be turned off. 
</p>

<p>
  <strong> Warning:</strong> This stream displays warning messages during the parsing of scene files and other 
 warnings. Despite the warning, POV-Ray can continue to render the scene. You will be informed if POV-Ray has made any 
 assumptions about your scene so that it can proceed. In general any time you see a warning, you should also assume 
 that this means that future versions of POV-Ray will not allow the warned action. Therefore you should attempt to 
 eliminate warning messages so your scene will be able to run in future versions of POV-Ray. This stream may be turned 
 off and/or directed to a text file.

  You may suppress the output to the console of the debug, fatal, render, statistic or warning text streams. For 
 example the <code> Statistic_Console=off</code> option or the <code>-GS</code> switch can turn off the statistic 
 stream. Using <code>on</code> or <code>+GS</code> you may turn it on again. You may also turn all five of these 
 streams on or off at once using the <code>All_Console</code> option or <code>+GA</code> switch. 
</p>

<p class="Note">
  <strong>Note:</strong> that these options take effect immediately when specified. Obviously any error 
 or warning messages that might occur before the option is read are not be affected.

<p>
  You may direct a copy of the text streams to a text file for the debug, fatal, render, statistic, or warning text 
 streams. For example the <code> Statistic_File</code>=<em>s</em> option or the <code>+GS</code><em>s</em> switch. If 
 the string <em>s</em> is <code>true</code> or any of the other valid <code>true</code> strings then that stream is 
 redirected to a file with a default name. Valid <code>true</code> values are <code>true</code>, <code> yes</code>, <code>on</code> 
 or <code>1</code>. If the value is <code> false</code> the direction to a text file is turned off. Valid <code> false</code> 
 values are <code>false</code>, <code>no</code>, <code> off</code> or <code>0</code>. Any other string specified turns 
 on file output and the string is interpreted as the output file name. 
</p>

<p>
  Similarly you may specify such a true, false or file name string after a switch such as <code> +GS</code><em>file</em>. 
 You may also direct all five streams to the same file using the <code>All_File</code> option or <code> +GA</code> 
 switch. You may not specify the same file for two or more streams because POV-Ray will fail when it tries to open or 
 close the same file twice.

  The <code>Quality=</code><em>n</em> option or <code>+Q</code><em>n</em> switch allows you to specify the image

 adjustments are made by eliminating some of the calculations that are normally performed. For example settings below 4 
 do not render shadows. Settings below 8 do not use reflection or refraction. The duplicate values allow for future 
 expansion. The values correspond to the following quality levels:

  POV-Ray uses a variety of spatial sub-division systems to speed up ray-object intersection tests. The primary 
 system uses a hierarchy of nested bounding boxes. This system compartmentalizes all finite objects in a scene into 
 invisible rectangular boxes that are arranged in a tree-like hierarchy. Before testing the objects within the bounding 
 boxes the tree is descended and only those objects are tested whose bounds are hit by a ray. This can greatly improve 
 rendering speed. However for scenes with only a few objects the overhead of using a bounding system is not worth the 
 effort. The <code> Bounding=off</code> option or <code>-MB</code> switch allows you to force bounding off. The default 
 value is on. 
</p>

<p>
  The <code> Bounding_Threshold=</code><em>n</em> or <code> +MB</code><em>n</em> switch allows you to set the minimum 
 number of objects necessary before bounding is used. The default is <code>+MB25</code> which means that if your scene 
 has fewer than 25 objects POV-Ray will automatically turn bounding off because the overhead is not worth it. Generally 
 it is a good idea to use a much lower threshold like <code>+MB5</code>. 
</p>

<p>
  Additionally POV-Ray uses systems known as <em>vista buffers</em> and <em> light buffers</em> to further speed 
 things up. These systems only work when bounding is on and when there are a sufficient number of objects to meet the 
 bounding threshold. The vista buffer is created by projecting the bounding box hierarchy onto the screen and 
 determining the rectangular areas that are covered by each of the elements in the hierarchy. Only those objects whose 
 rectangles enclose a given pixel are tested by the primary viewing ray. The vista buffer can only be used with 
 perspective and orthographic cameras because they rely on a fixed viewpoint and a reasonable projection (i. e. 
 straight lines have to stay straight lines after the projection). 
</p>

<p>
  The light buffer is created by enclosing each light source in an imaginary box and projecting the bounding box 
 hierarchy onto each of its six sides. Since this relies on a fixed light source, light buffers will not be used for 
 area lights. 
</p>

<p>
  Reflected and transmitted rays do not take advantage of the light and vista buffer. 
</p>

<p>
  The default settings are <code> Vista_Buffer=on</code> or <code>+UV</code> and <code> Light_Buffer=on</code> or <code>+UL</code>. 
 The option to turn these features off is available to demonstrate their usefulness and as protection against 
 unforeseen bugs which might exist in any of these bounding systems. 
</p>

<p>
  In general, any finite object and many types of CSG of finite objects will properly respond to this bounding 
 system. In addition blobs and meshes use an additional internal bounding system. These systems are not affected by the 
 above switch. They can be switched off using the appropriate syntax in the scene file (see &quot;<a href="s_105.html#s03_04_01_01">Blob</a>&quot; 
 and &quot;<a href="#l51">Mesh</a>&quot; for details). 
</p>

<p>
  Text objects are split into individual letters that are bounded using the bounding box hierarchy. Some CSG 
 combinations of finite and infinite objects are also automatically bound. The end result is that you will rarely need 
 to add manual bounding objects as was necessary in earlier versions of POV-Ray unless you use many infinite objects.

<p>
  Early versions of POV-Ray had no system of automatic bounding or spatial sub-division to speed up ray-object 
 intersection tests. Users had to manually create bounding boxes to speed up the rendering. Since version 3.0, POV-Ray 
 has had more sophisticated automatic bounding than any previous version. In many cases the manual bounding on older 
 scenes is slower than the new automatic systems. Therefore POV-Ray removes manual bounding when it knows it will help. 
 In rare instances you may want to keep manual bounding. Some older scenes incorrectly used bounding when they should 
 have used clipping. If POV-Ray removes the bounds in these scenes the image will not look right. To turn off the 
 automatic removal of manual bounds you should specify <code> Remove_Bounds=off</code> or use <code> -UR</code>. The 
 default is <code> Remove_Bounds=on</code>. 
</p>

<p>
  One area where the jury is still out is the splitting of manually bounded unions. Unbounded unions are always split 
 into their component parts so that automatic bounding works better. Most users do not bound unions because they know 
 that doing so is usually slower. If you do manually bound a union we presume you really want it bound. For safety sake 
 we do not presume to remove such bounds. If you want to remove manual bounds from unions you should specify <code>Split_Unions=on</code> 
 or use <code> +SU</code>. The default is <code>Split_Unions=off</code>.

<p>
  The ray-tracing process is in effect a discrete, digital sampling of the image with typically one sample per pixel. 
 Such sampling can introduce a variety of errors. This includes a jagged, stair-step appearance in sloping or curved 
 lines, a broken look for thin lines, moir&eacute; patterns of interference and lost detail or missing objects, which 
 are so small they reside between adjacent pixels. The effect that is responsible for those errors is called <em>aliasing</em>. 
 
</p>

<p>
  Anti-aliasing is any technique used to help eliminate such errors or to reduce the negative impact they have on the 
 image. In general, anti-aliasing makes the ray-traced image look <em> smoother</em>. The <code> Antialias=on</code> 
 option or <code>+A</code> switch turns on POV-Ray's anti-aliasing system. 
</p>

<p>
  When anti-aliasing is turned on, POV-Ray attempts to reduce the errors by shooting more than one viewing ray into 
 each pixel and averaging the results to determine the pixel's apparent color. This technique is called super-sampling 
 and can improve the appearance of the final image but it drastically increases the time required to render a scene 
 since many more calculations have to be done. 
</p>

<p>
  POV-Ray gives you the option to use one of two alternate super-sampling methods. The <code> Sampling_Method=</code><em>n</em> 
 option or <code> +AM</code><em>n</em> switch selects either type <code>1</code> or type <code> 2</code>. Selecting one 
 of those methods does not turn anti-aliasing on. This has to be done by using the <code>+A</code> command line switch 
 or <code> Antialias=on</code> option. 
</p>

<p>
  Type 1 is an adaptive, non-recursive, super-sampling method. It is <em> adaptive</em> because not every pixel is 
 super-sampled. Type 2 is an adaptive and recursive super-sampling method. It is <em>recursive</em> because the pixel 
 is sub-divided and sub-sub-divided recursively. The <em>adaptive</em> nature of type 2 is the variable depth of 
 recursion. 
</p>

<p>
  In the default, non-recursive method (<code>+AM1</code>), POV-Ray initially traces one ray per pixel. If the color 
 of a pixel differs from its neighbors (to the left or above) by at least the set threshold value then the pixel is 
 super-sampled by shooting a given, fixed number of additional rays. The default threshold is 0.3 but it may be changed 
 using the <code> Antialias_Threshold=</code><em>n.n</em> option. When the switches are used, the threshold may 
 optionally follow the <code>+A</code>. For example <code> +A0.1</code> turns anti-aliasing on and sets the threshold 
 to 0.1. 
</p>

<p>
  The threshold comparison is computed as follows. If r1, g1, b1 and r2, g2, b2 are the rgb components of two pixels 
 then the difference between pixels is computed by 
</p>

<pre>
  diff = abs(r1-r2) + abs(g1-g2) + abs(b1-b2)
</pre>

<p>
  If this difference is greater than the threshold then both pixels are super-sampled. The rgb values are in the 
 range from 0.0 to 1.0 thus the most two pixels can differ is 3.0. If the anti-aliasing threshold is 0.0 then every 
 pixel is super-sampled. If the threshold is 3.0 then no anti-aliasing is done. Lower threshold means more 
 anti-aliasing and less speed. Use anti-aliasing for your final version of a picture, not the rough draft. The lower 
 the contrast, the lower the threshold should be. Higher contrast pictures can get away with higher tolerance values. 
 Good values seem to be around 0.2 to 0.4. 
</p>

<p>
  When using the non-recursive method, the default number of super-samples is nine per pixel, located on a 3*3 grid. 
 The <code> Antialias_Depth=</code><em>n</em> option or <code> +R</code><em>n</em> switch controls the number of rows 
 and columns of samples taken for a super-sampled pixel. For example <code>+R4</code> would give 4*4=16 samples per 
 pixel. 
</p>

<p>
  The second, adaptive, recursive super-sampling method starts by tracing four rays at the corners of each pixel. If 
 the resulting colors differ more than the threshold amount additional samples will be taken. This is done recursively, 
 i.e. the pixel is divided into four sub-pixels that are separately traced and tested for further subdivision. The 
 advantage of this method is the reduced number of rays that have to be traced. Samples that are common among adjacent 
 pixels and sub-pixels are stored and reused to avoid re-tracing of rays. The recursive character of this method makes 
 the super-sampling concentrate on those parts of the pixel that are more likely to need super-sampling (see figure 
 below).<br><center><img alt="Example of how the recursive super-sampling works." src="images/reference/recsuper.png"></center> 
 
</p>

<p>
  The maximum number of subdivisions is specified by the <code> Antialias_Depth=</code><em>n</em> option or <code>+R</code><em>n</em> 
 switch. This is different from the adaptive, non-recursive method where the total number of super-samples is 
 specified. A maximum number of <em>n</em> subdivisions results in a maximum number of samples per pixel that is given 
 by the following table.

<p class="Note">
  <strong>Note:</strong> the maximum number of samples in the recursive case is hardly ever reached for 
 a given pixel. If the recursive method is used with no anti-aliasing each pixel will be the average of the rays traced 
 at its corners. In most cases a recursion level of three is sufficient. 
</p>

<p>
  Another way to reduce aliasing artefacts is to introduce noise into the sampling process. This is called <em>jittering</em> 
 and works because the human visual system is much more forgiving to noise than it is to regular patterns. The location 
 of the super-samples is jittered or wiggled a tiny amount when anti-aliasing is used. Jittering is used by default but 
 it may be turned off with the <code>Jitter=off</code> option or <code>-J</code> switch. The amount of jittering can be 
 set with the <code> Jitter_Amount=</code><em>n.n</em> option. When using switches the jitter scale may be specified 
 after the <code>+J</code><em>n.n</em> switch. For example <code>+J0.5</code> uses half the normal jitter. The default 
 amount of 1.0 is the maximum jitter which will insure that all super-samples remain inside the original pixel. 
</p>

<p class="Note">
  <strong>Note:</strong> the jittering noise is random and non-repeatable so you should avoid using 
 jitter in animation sequences as the anti-aliased pixels will vary and flicker annoyingly from frame to frame. 
</p>

<p>
  If anti-aliasing is not used one sample per pixel is taken regardless of the super-sampling method specified.
