  <strong>USAGE PROVISIONS</strong> 
</p>

<p>
  Subject to the terms and conditions of this agreement, permission is granted to the User to use the Software and 
 its associated files to create and render images. The creator of a scene file retains all rights to any scene files 
 they create, and any images generated by the Software from them. Subject to the other terms of this license, the User 
 is permitted to use the Software in a profit-making enterprise, provided such profit arises primarily from use of the

<p>
  The User is also granted the right to use the scene files, fonts, bitmaps, and include files distributed in the 
 INCLUDE and SCENES\INCDEMO sub- directories of the Software in their own scenes. Such permission does not extend to 
 any other files in the SCENES directory or its sub-directories. The SCENES files are for the User's enjoyment and 
 education but may not be the basis of any derivative works unless the file in question explicitly grants permission to 
 do such. 
</p>

<p>
  This licence does not grant any right of re-distribution or use in any manner other than the above. The Company has 
 separate license documents that apply to other uses (such as re-distribution via the internet or on CD); please visit 
 http://www.povray.org/povlegal.html for links to these. In particular you are advised that the sale, lease, or rental 
 of the Software in any form without written authority from the Company is explicitly prohibited.
