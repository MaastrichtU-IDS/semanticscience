Change 2524 on 2004/03/13 by chrisc@hyperthread

  Adds detection of merging of unions. For example code like
   #declare foo = union { object {foo} } ... } used in a loop will

18 January 2004 - 3.6.beta.1
----------------------------

Change 2405 on 2004/01/17 by chormann@titon

  [sample scenes] Comments for render parameters added to most scenes, 
    the unix sample scene render scripts look for a comment in the first 
    50 lines matching the regexp '^//[ ]+[+-]{1}[^ -]'.
  
  Additional change: the advanced/balcony scene had an include file
    glass.inc - changed this to bglass.inc to avoid interference with 
    system include file.

Change 2398 on 2004/01/16 by thorsten@host27

  Fixes problem with antialiasing options display

  Ensure radiosity globals are initialized even if radiosity is turned off.

Change 2295 on 2003/11/03 by thorsten@host27

  Removed povmsgid.h include from povms.h. Include it manually after
   povms.h where needed!
  Adds code for smart handling of INI files which contain value strings
   that are not quoted but contain spaces and other sepcial chars.
   The code now applies the rule that '+', '-', ';', '#', or ',' or the platform
   specific switch character (on Windows '/', non on Unix right now afaik)
   preceded by a space when parsing a string suggests the string ended
   prior to the preceding space. If any other character is found, it and
   the characters that follow are parsed as unquoted string, and if the
   result is a valid INI file option keyword name, then it is assumed the
   string is also a proper unquoted string. However, if the result string
   is no valid INI file option keyword name it is assumed the string is
   an incorrectly unquoted string with spaces. A (non-fatal) error
   message is issued and parsing continues until either the end of the
   line or until a comment character ';' or '#' is found.
   This should provide good backward compatibility while also pointing
   users to the correct INI file syntax.

Change 2271 on 2003/10/27 by thorsten@host27

  Fixes problem with memory stats reporting
  Fixes problem with function image float size

Change 2265 on 2003/10/23 by chormann@titon

  where required.

    intersection accruacy problems for a small torus very distant
    from the camera.

Change 2180 on 2003/08/19 by thorsten@host27

  Disables / for command-line switches on platforms where this
   is the directory separator. This allows paths beginning with a
   directory separator to be handled correctly.

Change 2172 on 2003/08/13 by thorsten@host27

  Adds a completely redone INI and switch parser.

Change 2164 on 2003/08/11 by thorsten@host27

Change 2162 on 2003/08/10 by chrisc@lilliput

  Fix issue reported by Andrew Coppin in 3eb9b38e@news.povray.org.
  sort_and_split had two seperate bugs in the bsphere tree reallocation logic
    (including a whopper where it reallocates the local copy of the tree but
    does not propagate the realloced array back to the calling routine) causing
    memory access violations.

  Fixes a TIFF and a PNG bug reported by Ray Gardener

Change 2045 on 2003/03/13 by thorsten@host27

  Workaround for default io restriction settings to at least work

 Changes to ease integration of a platform specific function just-in-time
  compiler.

Change 1949 on 2002/11/17 by thorsten@host27

 Adds macro POV_ASSIGN_PIXEL_UNCLIPPED
  Note: This macro currently returns values for all AA settings,
  however, when AA method one is used (the non-adaptive one) it
  will currently only return the not AA adjusted unclipped color.
 Warning, this cahnge also ch anges the way clipping colors is
  performed for AA method 2. Clipping is peformed after
  averaging the colors.
 Note that the unclipped color is also not gamma corrected
  and thus will always be different from the clipped color if
  the gamma is set to something different from 1.0.

Change 1947 on 2002/11/06 by thorsten@host27

  Adds hfield scaling bugfix

Change 1945 on 2002/11/06 by thorsten@host27

  Adds parametric object UV mapping patch.
  Adds Torus UV mapping patch.
  Adds superellipsoid speedup patch.
  Adds density file 16 and 32 bit integer data
   support that depends on the filesize, that is
   if the file is twice (minus header, of course)
   as long then it is assumed to contain 16 bit
   ints and if it is four times as long 32 bit ints.
  Adds density file tricubic interpolation.
  NOTE: All the above need serious testing!
  Removes the mesh and texture creation
   counters previously added for debugging.
  Removes missed sqrt in photon speedup
   changes (effectively the code in Perforce
   was not different from the orginal).

Change 1933 on 2002/10/06 by thorsten@host27

  POVMS now turns messages into flat data before
   placing them into the message queue. This i.e. allows
   messages to be passed between processes.

Change 1932 on 2002/10/06 by thorsten@host27

  Moves square root call in photons.cpp for major speedup.
  Completes POVMS message streaming functions.

Change 1931 on 2002/10/05 by thorsten@host27

  Adds POVMSStream_xxx utility functions for reading and
   writing data in network byteorder. The byteorder is determined
   automatically at runtime! Only on platforms on which IEEE 754
   floating-point numbers are not standard, the macros
   POVMSIEEEFloat, POVMSFloatToPOVMSIEEEFloat,
   POVMSIEEEFloatToPOVMSFloat and HexToPOVMSIEEEFloat
   have to be redefined.

Change 1930 on 2002/10/05 by thorsten@host27

  Fixes misc. crashes caused by various assumptions in various places.
  Fixes problems when using 64 bit file io functions.

Change 1916 on 2002/09/23 by thorsten@host27

  Fixes three incorrect uses of Assign_Vector
