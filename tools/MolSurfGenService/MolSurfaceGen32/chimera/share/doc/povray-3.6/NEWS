POV-Ray 3.6 for UNIX/Linux - NEWS
===============================================================================

A list of changes for the platform independent part of the program
can be found in doc/revision.txt .


========================================
New features and changes from 3.5 to 3.6
========================================

  a) PC-Linux binary version

     - a new install script that allows both system wide (as root) and user
       level install.  There are various possibilities to do the installation
       so there might be problems in some cases.  Before you report a problem
       make sure you read the text the install script prints on the screen
       carefully, in some cases there are additional actions required to get 
       a working installation.

  b) generic UNIX source version

     - a completely rewritten and much more universal configure script.
       see INSTALL for more information.

  c) all versions

     - new documentation format.  It has been tested with several newer
       browsers, Netscape 4.x will not work well unless you disable style 
       sheets.

       Note some of the png images do not display correctly in some newer 
       versions of Konqueror.  This is a bug in Konqueror.  A possible 
       workaround would be to process all png images through the NetPBM
       tools:

         pngtopnm image_old.png | pnmtopng > image.png

     - new default locations for the configuration files (povray.ini and
       povray.conf).  See chapter 1 of the documentation for details.

     - a new io-restrictions configuration file format.  The new format is 
       not compatible to 3.5 but due to the changed file locations this
       does not prevent parallel use of POV-Ray 3.5 and 3.6.

     - sample scene render scripts.  See section 1.3.6 of the docs for
       instructions how to use them.

     - a benchmark rendering mode: see section 1.6.2 of the docs.

     - KDE integration (file types and panel icons)  If someone here is
       familiar with doing the same kind of thing in GNOME this would be 
       helpful.

     - various internal changes not directly visible to the user.
