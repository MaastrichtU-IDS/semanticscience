<p>
This dialog displays sequences of volume data sets.  Examples are 3-D
optical microscopy time series, or a sequence of single particle
density map reconstructions.  Each volume of a series has an index
starting from 0 which is refered to as the <b>time</b> for that volume.
</p>

<p>
The volume series dialog is displayed using menu entry
</p>

<pre>
	Tools / Volume Data / Volume Series

<h2>
Supported File Formats
</h2>

<p>
A collection of volume data files can be opened and sorted by file name to
form a series.  Typically the files will have a common prefix and a numeric
suffix, for example, tmv001.mrc, tmv002.mrc, ....
</p>

<p>
Currently the only supported format for a single file containing multiple
volumes is Priism with file suffix ".xyzt" recognized as Priism time series
data (optical microscopy).
</p>

<p>
Multifile volume series are opened using the <b>Open...</b> button at
the bottom of the volume series dialog.  Single file Priism time series
can be opened with that dialog or with the Chimera File / Open... menu
entry.
</p>

<h2>
Data Display
</h2>

<img src="vs_dialog.png" align=right>

<p>
The volume data for a given time point is displayed using settings in
the Volume Viewer dialog.  The time slider in the Volume Series
dialog controls which time point is displayed.  The time values are
integers starting from 0.  Each time point is treated as a different
volume data set and has its own entry in the data menu at the top of
the Volume Viewer dialog.  The Volume Series dialog just provides
a convenient way of controlling the Volume Viewer dialog when looking
at sequences of volume data sets.
</p>

<p>
The Volume Viewer dialog updates to show the settings of the current
time point only after the time value stops changing for 1 second.
This is to provide faster playback speed, as updating the volume
dialog histogram is time consuming.
</p>

<h2>
Cycling through the Sequence
</h2>

<p>
The <b>Play</b> button cycles through displaying data at each time.
After pressing the
<b>Play</b> button, the button name will change to <b>Stop</b>.  The
<b>Play direction</b> setting allows playing through the times forward
or backward.  With forward play the display loops back to the
beginning when the last time is reached.  Likewise backward play loops
to the end and continues playing backwards.  The <b>oscillate</b> setting
first plays forward to the end and then reverses and plays backwards to
the beginning.
</p>

<p>
The <b>Maximum playback speed</b> setting limits how fast the time
value is updated when the Play button is pressed.  This settings is to
avoid excessively fast playback speed.  If the Maximum playback speed
checkbutton is off, then Chimera will render each time once and then
advance to the next time.  This fastest playback rate may be quite slow
if the data set is large.
</p>

<h2>
Display Settings (thresholds, colors ...)
</h2>

<p>
The display thresholds, style (surface, mesh, solid), step size, colors,
subregion, and rendering options can be changed using the Volume Viewer dialog.
When the volume series dialog displays a new time point it copies the settings
from the time point currently displayed in the volume viewer dialog.
</p>

<p>
Note that the Volume Viewer dialog does not show settings for the most
recently displayed time point until 1 second after the Volume
Series slider has stopped moving.
</p>

<p>
If a volume data set that is not part of the time series is shown in the
volume viewer dialog, then a newly displayed time point gets the settings
of the previously displayed time point, and not the volume viewer dialog
settings.
</p>

<h2>
Automatic Threshold Normalization
</h2>

<p>
If the <b>Normalize threshold levels</b> switch is turned on then the
threshold level for a newly shown time point is calculated so that its
rank is the same as the rank of the threshold for the time point shown
in the volume viewer dialog.  That is, if the volume viewer dialog
threshold level is greater than exactly 78% of volume data values for
that time, then the threshold for the new time will be set such that
it is greater than 78% of volume data values for the new time.  The
effect is that the volume enclosed by the contour surface is kept
constant (strictly speaking the number of grid points is constant).
</p>

<p>
This normalization is useful when the signal level in the volume data
changes over time.  If the switch is off then the threshold value for
a new time point is set to the same threshold value as the previous time
point.
</p>

<p>
Each surface and solid rendering thresholds is adjusted as described.
</p>

<h2>
Optimizing Playback Speed
</h2>

<p>
Two options can dramatically increase the playback speed.  The two
time consuming steps in rendering volume data for a given time are
reading the data from disk, and calculation the surface or solid
rendering.  Increasing the <b>Data cache size</b> to a value larger
than the file size allows holding all data in memory so it is only
read from disk the first time it is displayed.  Turning on the
<b>Cache renderings</b> option causes the most recently calculated
surface or solid rendering for a specified number of time points to be
saved in memory.  These two settings can increase the playback speed
by more than a factor of 10.
</p>

<h3>
Appropriate Cache Settings
</h3>

<p>
Setting the data cache size close to or larger than the physical
memory in the computer will lead to the computer swapping data to disk
when no more memory is available (called "thrashing").  This will cause
degraded performance of the entire computer system.
</p>

<p>
Caching renderings does not use the data cache.  There is no limit to
how much memory will be used when caching renderings so judgment is
required when turning this on.  Surface renderings take memory
proportional to the number of triangles composing the surface.  Solid
renderings take about 6 bytes per grid point using colormapping
(default) or 20 bytes without using colormapping (an option in Volume
Viewer, menu entry Features / Solid Rendering Options).  For 2 byte
data values this is up to 10 times more memory than the actual data
set.  So caching solid renderings is generally only feasible when
looking at data with small x,y,z dimensions.  Volume step size and
subregion display reduce the rendering memory use in solid mode which
is proportional to the number of data voxels displayed.
</p>

<p>
Volume data associated with cached renderings are always kept in memory
even if this causes the total cached data to exceed the data cache size limit.
</p>

<h2>
Placing Markers and Tracing Paths
</h2>

<p>
Turning on the <b>Show markers</b> switch enables placing spherical
markers on the data and tracing spatial and temporal paths using the
<a href="http://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/docs/ContributedSoftware/volumepathtracer/framevolpath.html">Volume Path Tracer</a>
tool.  Each marker is labeled
with the time of the volume on which it was placed.  The labels are not
shown.  They are used by the volume series tool to display only
those markers associated with the currently displayed time.  Markers
can also be shown for a specified number of earlier time points and
later time points than the current time.
</p>

<p>
The volume series tool controls display of markers from the current
marker set shown in the volume path tracer dialog.  Multiple marker
sets can be created and any one can be chosen for display using the
path tracer dialog.
</p>

<p>
Placed markers can be saved with the <b>Export XML</b> option under
the <b>Sets</b> tab on the Volume Path Tracer dialog.  The markers can
be loaded using the Chimera File / Open menu entry provided the file
has the Chimera marker set file suffix *.cmm.
</p>

<h2>
Coloring Contour Surfaces to Match Markers
</h2>

<p>
Volume contour surfaces can be colored to match the color of the markers
in a zone near the markers using the <b>Color zone around markers</b>
switch.  All of the markers associated with the current time are used
to color the current contour surface.  The surface will be colored up
to the specified distance away from the markers.  The coloring does not
apply when volumetric display style ("solid" mode in volume viewer) is
used.
</p>

<h2>
Notes
</h2>

<p>
<b>No session saving support</b>.  The volume series tool does not
support session saving.  A saved and restored session will have the
volumes shown in the Volume Viewer dialog but they will not be
associated with the Volume Series dialog, and there is no way to then
apply the Volume Series dialog to the already open volumes.  Placed
markers and traced paths can be saved and reused with the volume
series tool.  See the section of markers and paths for details.
</p>

<p>
<b>Slow playback when caching renderings</b>.  The second time a
surface is displayed a graphics optimization (building an OpenGL
display list) is done to speed up future drawing of that same surface
by putting it in graphics card memory.  That optimization is time
consuming.  The third time the surface is displayed will take
much less time if the graphics card has sufficient memory.
</p>

<p>
<b>Threshold normalization brightness glitches in solid mode</b>.
Sometimes a time point will appear dimmer than neighboring times when
using solid rendering and threshold normalization.  This can happen
when only two nodes are used to specify the transfer function on the
volume viewer histogram with one of the nodes at the highest data
value.  If a particular time point has a maximum data value much
higher than neighboring times then that will substantially lower the
brightness at typical data values.  This can be remedied by adding a
third node between the high and low nodes by ctrl-clicking on the
volume viewer histogram.

<p>
<b>August 4, 2006.</b>
Added maximum playback speed, play direction, and color zone options.
</p>
