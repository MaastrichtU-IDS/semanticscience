<h1>Hydrogen-Addition Information Request Panel</h1>
<p>For most typical biomolecules, chimera's
<a href="http://www.cgl.ucsf.edu:16160/chimera/docs/UsersGuide/idatm.html">atom typing</a>
algorithm provides enough information to add hydrogens
without intervention by the user.
On occasion however, some unusual atoms cannot be
typed by the algorithm and the user must be queried
to determine the expected bond geometries and
number of bond partners.
<p>This document is unfinished.
