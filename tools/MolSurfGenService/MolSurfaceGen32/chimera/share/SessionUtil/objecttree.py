# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Routines to encode a tree of objects as basic Python types.
# The basic types are numbers, strings, None, tuples, lists, dictionaries.
# The purpose of this is to make a representation that is easily saved
# to a file.  The file should be human readable.
#
# The Python pickle module also serializes objects but does not provide
# human readable output.
#

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# A tree of instances and basic Python types is converted to a tree of only
# basic types (numbers, strings, None, tuples, lists, dictionaries).
#
# Instances are replaced by dictionaries which include a key indicating the
# instance class name.  Instance should have an attribute called
# state_attributes set to a sequence of attribute names.  These are the
# only attributes that will be included in the basic tree.
#
# An instance cannot appear more than once in the input tree.
# A dictionary key cannot be an instance.
#
# These two restrictions could be lifted in a more complex implementation
# that makes unique copies of the instances and returns an object that
# gives the tree of basic types with references to unique instances,
# and a list of the unique instances converted to basic types.  This has
# not been done since it is not currently needed.
