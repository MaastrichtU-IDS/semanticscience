class Trans:
	"""Transformation matrix generator.

Data: matrix

Methods:
   t = Trans([shift],[center],[axis],[angle],[units])
      NOTE: (x,y,z) or (x,y,z,1) treated as Vector, (x,y,z,0) as Coord
      shift=Vector: translate by this vector (applied last)
      shift=Coord: translate this coordinate to the origin (applied last)
      center=Coord: rotate about this coordinate
      axis=Vector: rotate around line along this direction from center
      axis=Coord: rotate around line from center to this coordinate
      angle: amount to rotate in units
   t(atom) - modify coordinates of an atom
   t(group) - modify coordinates of a group of atoms
   t(trans2) - left-multiply another transformation
