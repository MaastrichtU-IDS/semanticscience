# This file contains extra information about various hardware configurations
# based on the OpenGL getString (glGetString(3)) vendor, renderer, version,
# and extension strings.  "Extra information" means information about the
# graphics hardware that can't be easily determined by software.  Some
# performance related information may creep in here, but that should be
# determined by an analysis program.
#
# This file is read sequentially, later sections override earlier sections,
# so the information for particular platforms should be later in the file.
# The sections of this file that match the current platform give extra
# information about that platform.  An unspecified field matches any value.
# When the vendor field is encountered, all other fields are reset to
# unspecified.
#
# Control options:
#	These options control if the configuration options below apply to
#	the current hardware.  Expressions are POSIX extended regular
#	expressions -- special characters are ^.[]$()|*+?{}\ -- e.g. ()
#	for grouping, [] for classes -- see regex(7).
#
#	VENDOR expression
#		Match expression against vendor string.
#
#	RENDERER expression
#		Match expression against renderer string.
#
#	VERSION expression
#		Match expression against version string.
#
#	EXTENSION expression
#		Match expression against extension string.
#
#	OS expression
#		Match expression against local os release string (the output
#		from "uname -r" on most Posix systems, -R on SGI systems).
#		Caveat: this only works if running chimera locally, use
#		VERSION instead if at all possible.
#
#	The effect of the above control options are nested.
#
# The configuration options are (with the default value):
#
#	debug [0|1|2]
#		If non-zero, turn on informational messages about the
#		parsing of this file.  Level 2 gives more information.
#
#	message text
#		Output text to standard error stream.
#
#	fatal text
#		Throw a runtime exception with the given text.
#
#
#	disable feature-name
#		Disable named OpenGL feature.  See below.
#
#	enable feature-name
#		Reenable named OpenGL feature.  See below.
#		details.
#
#	pedanticAALines 0.0
#		This option is for platforms that output absolutely correct
#		anti-aliased lines with low alpha values for edge pixels.  A
#		positive value filters out edge pixels whose alpha is less
#		than or equal the given value.  A zero value disables this
#		correction.
#
#	badStereoBoolean
#		If 1, then glGetBooleanv(GL_STEREO) always returns
#		false, so use GLX 1.3 calls to figure out if current
#		visual supports stereo.  SGI only.
#
# Feature names can either be names of OpenGL extensions or other
# OpenGL features that we have found driver bugs for.
#
#	Standard extensions in OpenGL 1.1:
#			VertexArray
#
#	Standard extensions in OpenGL 1.2:
#			TextureEdgeClamp, Texture3D,
#			SeparateSpecularColor, DrawRangeElements
#
#	Standard extensions in OpenGL 1.3:
#			Multisample, Multitexture, CubeMap
#
#	Standard extensions in OpenGL 1.4:
#			PointParameters, BlendEquation, BlendFuncSeparate,
#			WindowPos, Shadows
#
#	Standard extensions in OpenGL 1.5:
#			VertexBufferObject
#
#	Standard extensions in OpenGL 2.0:
#			Shading
#
#	Other extensions we're interested in:
#			CompiledVertexArray, CullVertex, ColorTable,
#			TextureColorTable, PalettedTexture
#
#	Windowing system features:
#			ChoosePixelFormat (Windows), FBConfig (X11)
#
#	Other features:
#
#	TrustNormals
#		If disabled, always renormalize normals.  Works around
#		bug with scaling perpendicular to the normal.
#
#	AntialiasLines
#		If disabled, then don't use antialiased lines ever.
#
#	AntialiasPoints
#		If disabled, then don't use antialiased points ever.
#
#	TrustColorLogicBlend
#		If disabled, then enabling/disabling GL_COLOR_LOGIC_OP
#		screws up alpha blending.
#
#	CompileAndExecute
#		If disabled, then display lists that are created with
#		GL_COMPILE_AND_EXECUTE are much slower than ones that
#		are compiled first, then called.
#
#	StereoRubberBanding
#		If disabled, then using glDrawBuffer(GL_FRONT) when in
#		quad-bufferred stereo only draws in one eye (left).
#		So rubberbanding doesn't work.
#
#	StereoMultisample
#		If disabled, then multisampling combined with quad-bufferred
#		stereo doesn't work.
#
#	FastMultisampling
#		If disabled, then using multisampling is very slow (chimera
#		surface bench is 50X slower or more).  This is typically
#		only needed for software renderers that support multisampling
#		or hardware renderers that use main memory.
