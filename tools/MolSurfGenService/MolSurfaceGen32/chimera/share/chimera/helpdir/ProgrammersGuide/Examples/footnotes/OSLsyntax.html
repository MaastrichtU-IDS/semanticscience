<h1>Object Selection Language syntax</h1>

<p>The OSL is a syntax for choosing Selectables.
There are four generic types of Selectables:
graphs, subgraphs, vertices, and edges.
In a molecular model, these correspond to the entire molecule,
the residues, atoms, and bonds.
For a non-molecular model, the only relevant Selectable type, graph,
corresponds to the entire model.

<p>The OSL is almost exactly the same as the Midas atom specification
syntax as implemented in the Chimera Midas emulator.
A detailed description of that syntax can be found
<a href="../../../UsersGuide/midas/atom_spec.html">here</a>.
There are three features found in Midas atom specifiers 
that are not found in the OSL.
They are:
<ol>
	<li>Current selection synonyms (&quot;selected&quot;, &quot;sel&quot;, <i>etc</i>.).
	<li>Zones (<i>e.g.</i> &quot;z&lt;5&quot;)
	<li>Intersections (the &amp; symbol)

</ol>
