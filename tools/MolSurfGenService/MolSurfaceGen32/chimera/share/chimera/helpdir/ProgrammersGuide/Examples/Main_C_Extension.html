<h1>Writing a C/C++ Chimera Extension</h1>

<h2>Caveat</h2>
<p>
The header files declaring Molecules, Residues, <i>etc.</i>, are
<a href="../index.html">available for download</a>.
This allows C/C++ extensions to work with molecular
data classes, but not add methods and/or data to those classes.  The
support for inserting methods and data into molecular classes will be
made available some time later in the Chimera &quot;developer&quot; release.
</p>

<h2>What you can do now</h2>

<p>
Basically, you write an extension conforming to Python's normal
<a href="http://www.python.org/doc/current/ext/ext.html">C/C++ API</a>.
Once you have a compiled shared library, put it in Chimera's <tty>lib</tty>
subdirectory and you will then be able to import it and use its 
functions from your Python code.
