<h2>
<a name="q1">
1) Where is the programming documentation?
</a>
</h2>

<p>
The
<a href="Examples/index.html">Programming Examples</a>
are a good source of information.
More information can be gleamed from the C++ header files for the Chimera
objects.
Those header files are available in the
<a href="http://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/sourcecode.html">source code</a> download.
Another source of object info is the <code>help()</code> function in
the Chimera's IDLE Python shell (under General Controls).
For example, <code>help(chimera.Atom)</code> will show (C++) methods and
attributes of Atom objects.
Even more information is available via chimera developer's mailing list,
<a href="mailto:chimera-dev@cgl.ucsf.edu">chimera-dev@cgl.ucsf.edu</a>.
The archived mailing list is at
<a href="http://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/pipermail/chimera-dev/">http://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/pipermail/chimera-dev</a>.
</p>

<h2>
<a name="q2">
2) How to emulate command-line functionality.
</a>
</h2>

<p>
Commands available at the type-in command line are almost all implemented in
the Midas module's __init__.py file.  You can use the commands for convenience
in implementing the same functionality in your extension.  For example, to
color iron atoms red:
</p>

<pre>
import Midas
Midas.color('red', '@/element=Fe')
</pre>

<p>
A few commands related to processing command text (<i>e.g.</i> handling files
of commands) are in Midas.midas_text.  One in particular, makeCommand(),
allows you to use command-line syntax directly instead of determining the
proper arguments to a Midas module function.  So the above example of coloring
atoms red would look like this using runCommand():

<pre>
from chimera import runCommand
runCommand("color red @/element=Fe")
</pre>

<p>
Note that if the command text may contain errors (<i>e.g.</i> it is based
on user input), <code>runCommand()</code> can raise <code>MidasError</code>
(defined in the Midas module)
so in such cases you may want to embed the <code>runCommand()</code> in a 
<code>try/except</code> block.

<p>In pre-1.2107 versions of Chimera, the <code>runCommand()</code>
convenience function doesn't exist, so you'd have to use
the functionally identical <code>makeCommand()</code> as follows:

<pre>
import Midas
from Midas.midas_text import makeCommand
makeCommand("color red @/element=Fe")
</pre>

<h2>
<a name="q3">
3) Passing arguments to scripts.
</a>
</h2>

<p>
Use the <code>--script</code> option to put all unprocessed
arguments into <code>sys.argv</code> for the given Python script to handle
instead of having chimera try to open each one.
A typical way to run the script would be:
</p>

<pre>
chimera --nogui --nostatus --script script.py -- -p 1jhg
</pre>

The resulting <code>sys.argv</code> would be <code>['script.py', '-p', '1jhg']</code>.
The <code>--</code> argument terminates the chimera arguments
and is only necessary if
there are arguments with a leading dash for your script.
<p>
To make your Python script look like any other command line tool,
you can provide a shell script
that only takes the Python script's arguments:
</p>

<pre>
#!/bin/sh
SCRIPT=PATH-TO-SCRIPT.py
chimera --nogui --nostatus --script "$SCRIPT" -- "$@"
</pre>

<h2>
<a name="q4">
4) How to rotate/translate the camera.
</a>
</h2>

<p>
Camera always points in -z direction.  There is no way to rotate it.
Instead, rotate all of the models.
</p>

<pre>
>>> v = chimera.viewer
>>> c = v.camera
>>> print c.center
(5.9539999961853027, -2.186500072479248, 10.296500205993652)
>>> c.center = (3, 2.5, 10)	# to translate camera
>>> v.scaleFactor = 1.5		# to zoom camera
</pre>

<h2>
<a name="q5">
5) How to rotate/translate individual models.
</a>
</h2>

<p>
The Xform object <a href="#q10">model.openState.xform</a>
retrieves a copy of the rotation and translation transformation for a model.
</p>

<pre>
>>> om = chimera.openModels
>>> mlist = om.list()
>>> m = mlist[0]
>>> axis = chimera.Vector(1, 0, 0)
>>> angle = 90			# degrees
>>> xf = chimera.Xform.rotation(axis, angle)
>>> print m.openState.xform	# 3x3 rotation matrix
				# last column is translation
0.982695 0.121524 0.139793 -1.07064
0.0250348 0.660639 -0.750287 6.83425
-0.183531 0.740803 0.646164 6.35578
>>> m.openState.globalXform(xf)
</pre>

<p>
Another method to change the transform
</p>

<pre>
>>> curxform = m.openState.xform # get copy (not reference)
>>> xf.premultiply(curxform)	 # changes xf
>>> m.openState.xform = xf	 # set it
</pre>

<p>
To rotate relative to model's data axes use
</p>

<pre>
>>> m.openState.localXform(xf)
</pre>

<p>
or
</p>

<pre>
>>> curxform = m.openState.xform # get copy (not reference)
>>> xf.multiply(curxform)	 # changes xf
>>> m.openState.xform = xf	 # set it
</pre>

<h2>
<a name="q6">
6) How to save the current view as an image.
</a>
</h2>

<pre>
import Midas
Midas.copy(file='/home/goddard/hoohoo.png', format='PNG')
# format can be 'PNG', 'JPEG', 'TIFF', 'PS', 'EPS'
</pre>

<h2>
<a name="q7">
7) Some attributes return a copy of an object.
</a>
</h2>

<pre>
>>> xf = model.openState.xform	# xf is a copy of the model's Xform matrix.
>>> xf.zRotate(45)		# This will not rotate the model.
</pre>

<pre>
>>> c = model.atoms[0].color	# c is the MaterialColor object for the atom
>>> c.ambientDiffuse = (1,0,0)	# The Atom color changes immediately to red.
</pre>

<p>
Some Chimera objects returned as attributes are always copies, some are
always references to the uncopied object.  Objects that are always copied
include Xform, Vector, Point, Sphere, Element, MolResId, Coord, ....
Objects that
are never copied include Atom, Bond, PseudoBond, CoordSet, Molecule, Residue,
RibbonStyle, ....  These objects that are not copied do not have any
any method for copying them.  In order to know if an object type is 
passed by value is to look at the Chimera C++ header files.  Classes without
a WrapPy base class are copied.  Those with a WrapPy base class are not copied.
This base class is part of the C++ to Python interface generation.

<h2>
<a name="q8">
8) Explanation of transparency for Surface_Model, MSMSModel and VRMLModel.
</a>
</h2>

<p>
Volume viewer isosurfaces are Surface_Model objects defined by the
_surface.so C++ module.  The Surface_Model interface is given in the
surfmodel.h source code file.  By default these surfaces use OpenGL (1,1-alpha)
blending.  This means the color for a triangle is added to an image plus
the transparency (= 1-alpha) times the color from triangles in back
of this one.  As the transparency becomes greater, the brightness of
the triangle does not diminish.  In fact, more shows through from behind
the triangle
so it appears brighter.  The specular highlights stay bright
even if the triangle is black and fully tranparent.  In Chimera 1730
a Surface_Model attribute transparency_blend_mode was added to allow
the more common (alpha,1-alpha) blend mode.  This is like the above mode
but the triangle color is multiplied by alpha
before being added to the image.  For highly transparent triangles
alpha is close to zero, and the triangle and specular highlights become
dim.
</p>

<p>
MSMS molecular surface models use (alpha, 1-alpha) blending.
They also use a 2 pass algorithm which is faster than sorting all the
triangles by depth, but gives the strictly correct appearance only
when the viewer looks through at most 2 surface layers.
</p>

<p>
VRML models use (alpha,1) blending.  That is they multiply triangle color
by alpha, but add in all of the color from triangles further back without
reducing it by the transparency factor.  This
is like complete transparency, where the triangle colors are just scaled
by the alpha value.  This is horrible looking unless you want complete
transparency.
</p>

<h2>
<a name="q9">
9) Transparency displayed incorrectly when 2 or more models are transparent.
</a>
</h2>

<p>
The Chimera architecture only correctly displays transparency when at
most one transparent model is shown.  Any number of opaque models can
also be shown.  If two transparent models are shown, one will be drawn
after the other.  This will make one appear as if it is drawn entirely
on top of another even if they in actuality intersect.  The rearmost
model, may in fact appear to be in front.  This is because Chimera
sorts the triangles by depth within a single model as needed for
rendering transparency, but is not able to sort triangles by depth across
multiple models.
</p>

<h2>
<a name="q10">
10) Explanation of openState attribute.
</a>
</h2>

<p>
The <code>openState</code> attribute of a Model controls whether that model
is active for motion ('<code>.active</code>'), and contains the model's
transformation matrix ('<code>.xform</code>') and center of rotation
('<code>.cofr</code>').  Since some models must move in synchrony
(<i>e.g.</i> a molecule and its surface), OpenState instances may shared
among multiple models.  If you create a model that needs a shared
<code>openState</code> with another model, then when adding your model
to the list of open models with <code>chimera.openModels.add()</code>,
you should use the '<code>sameAs</code>' keyword to specify that other model.
</p>

<h2>
<a name="q11">
11) Memory leaks in scripts.
</a>
</h2>

<p>
In the 1700 release, Chimera uses a substantial amount of memory to hold
molecular data, but does not have any large memory leaks to the best of
our knowledge (<i>i.e.</i> as structures are closed their memory usage 
will be reclaimed).  However, the memory is reclaimed by a task that runs
during idle times, so therefore scripts that loop through many structures,
opening and closing them, will have their memory use grow continuously
until the script finishes.  This will often cause the script to fail as
the Chimera process runs out of memory.
<p>
You can cause the memory-reclamation task to run during your script by
calling:
<pre><code>    chimera.update.checkForChanges()</code></pre>
<p>
You would want to call this after closing models in your script.  Since
the checkForChanges() routine also allows
<a href="http://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/docs/ProgrammersGuide/Examples/Main_AtomTrigger.html">triggers</a>
to fire, you might want to also put it after any code that opens models.
For example, the code that assigns surface categories to models runs
from a trigger callback, so adding a molecular surface may not work as
expected if checkForChanges() is not called after a molecule is opened.
<p>
In post-1700 releases and snapshots, checkForChanges() is called automatically
when models are opened or closed, so you will not need to insert these
calls into your code.

12) Getting the size of a volume data set.
</a>
</h2>

<p>
Here's some code to find the size of a volume data set.
</p>

<pre>
import VolumeViewer
d = VolumeViewer.volume_dialog()
d0 = d.data_sets[0]	# There may be more than one data set opened
			# You could look at each one's name (= file name)
			# to find the one you want.
data = d0.data		# This is a Grid_Data object defined in
			# VolumeData/griddata.py
xsize, ysize, zsize = data.size
</pre>

<a name="q13">
13) How to write out a PDB file containing the crystal unit cell.
</a>
</h2>

<p>
Here's code that creates the copies of a PDB molecule needed to fill
out a crystallographic unit cell, then writes all the copies to a new
PDB file.  This code uses the standard Chimera 1.1892 PDBmatrices
module, which uses the PDB SMTRY remarks or CRYST1 record to determine
the needed transformations.
</p>

<p>
You can run it without a graphical user interface as follows
<p>

<pre>
	% chimera --nogui myfile.pdb writeunitcell.py
</pre>

<p>
where the writeunitcell.py file contains the script given below.
</p>

<pre>
# Get the Molecule that has already been opened
import chimera
m = chimera.openModels.list()[0]

# Get the symmetry matrices
import PDBmatrices
tflist = PDBmatrices.crystal_symmetry_matrices(m.pdbHeaders)

# Get center of bounding box
import UnitCell
center = UnitCell.molecule_center(m)

# Get CRYST1 line from PDB headers
cryst1 = m.pdbHeaders['CRYST1'][0]

# Getting crystal parameters
from PDBmatrices import crystal
cp = crystal.pdb_cryst1_parameters(cryst1)
a,b,c,alpha,beta,gamma = cp[:6]

# Adjust matrices to produce close packing.
cpm = PDBmatrices.close_packing_matrices(tflist, center, a, b, c, alpha, beta, gamma)

# Apply transformations to copies of Molecule
mlist = []
from PDBmatrices import matrices
path = m.openedAs[0]			# Path to original PDB file
for tf in cpm:
    xf = matrices.chimera_xform(tf)	# Chimera style transform matrix
    m.openState.globalXform(xf)
    mlist.append(m)
    m = chimera.openModels.open(path)[0]	# Open another copy

# Write PDB file with transformed copies of molecule
import Midas
out_path = 'unitcell.pdb'
Midas.write(mlist, None, out_path)
</pre>

14) How to access files within the Chimera app on Macs.
</a>
</h2>
<p>
One way to access the Python code and other Chimera files on a Mac
is to right-click on the Chimera app icon and choose "Show Package Contents" 
from the resulting pop-up menu.  Another way is to use Terminal.app
and the command "cd" to navigate into the Chimera.app directory and
its subdirectories.  Most files of interest can be found under
Contents/Resources/share/.
