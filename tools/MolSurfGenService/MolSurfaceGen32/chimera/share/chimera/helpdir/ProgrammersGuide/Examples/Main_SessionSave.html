<h1>Saving Extension State in a Session File</h1>

<p>
This example shows how an extension can save its state in a Chimera session
file.  A session file is Python code that is executed by Chimera to restore
the state information.  The SimpleSession module saves the core Chimera
state such as opened molecules and the camera settings.  It then invokes
a SAVE_SESSION trigger that extensions can receive to save their state.
</p>

<h2>
Example <i>SessionSaveExample.py</i>
</h2>

<p>
The code below saves state variables "some_path" and "some_number" in
a session file when the Save Session menu entry is used.
</p>

<font color="red">
<pre>
some_path = '/home/smith/tralala.data'
some_number = 3

def restoreState(path, number):
  global some_path, some_number
  some_path = path
  some_number = number

def saveSession(trigger, x, file):
  restoring_code = \
"""
def restoreSessionSaveExample():
  import SessionSaveExample
  SessionSaveExample.restoreState(%s,%s)
try:
  restoreSessionSaveExample()
except:
  reportRestoreError('Error restoring SessionSaveExample')
"""
  state = (repr(some_path), repr(some_number))
  file.write(restoring_code % state)

import chimera
import SimpleSession
chimera.triggers.addHandler(SimpleSession.SAVE_SESSION, saveSession, None)
</pre>
</font>

<p>
The last line registers the saveSession routine to be called when
the SAVE_SESSION trigger is invoked.  This happens when the user saves
the session from the Chimera file menu.  The saveSession routine
writes Python code to the session file that will restore the
state of the some_path and some_number global variables.
</p>

<h3>Large Data Structures</h3>
<p>
If you need to save data structures whose <code>repr()</code> would be
hundreds or thousands of characters long, you should use SimpleSession's
<code>sesRepr()</code> function instead which will insert newlines periodically.
The resulting session has
a better chance of being user-editable and passing through various mailer
programs without corruption.
</p>

<h2>
Session File Format
</h2>

<p>
Here is the code written to the session file by the above example.
</p>

<pre>
def restoreSessionSaveExample():
  import SessionSaveExample
  SessionSaveExample.restoreState('/home/smith/tralala.data','3')
try:
  restoreSessionSaveExample()
except:
  reportRestoreError('Error restoring SessionSaveExample')
</pre>

<p>
Code written by other extensions will appear before and after this code.
The restoreSessionSaveExample function is defined to keep
extra names out of the global namespace of the session file.  This is
to avoid name conflicts.  The restoreSessionSaveExample
routine is called within
a try statement so that if an error occurs it won't prevent
code later in the session file from being called.  The reportRestoreError
routine is defined at the top of the session file by SimpleSession.
</p>

<h2>
Saving Complex Data
</h2>

<p>
The SessionUtil module helps writing and reading the state data for
extensions that have alot of state.  It can convert class instances
to dictionaries so they can be written to a file.  This is similar to
the standard Python pickle module but provides better human readable
formatted output.  It can handle a tree of data structures.
Look at the ScaleBar extension code to see how to use SessionUtil.
</p>

<h2>Restoring References to Molecular Data</h2>
You can save references to molecules, residues, atom, bonds, pseudobonds,
VRML models, and MSMS surfaces by calling SimpleSession's <code>sessionID()</code> function
with the item to save as the only argument.  The <code>repr()</code> of the
return value can then be written into the session file.  During the
restore, the written session ID value should be given to SimpleSession's
<code>idLookup()</code> function,
which will return the corresponding molecular data item.

<h3>Custom Molecular Attributes</h3>
If you add non-standard attributes to Molecules/Residues/Bonds/Atoms that
you want preserved in restored sessions, use SimpleSession's
<code>restoreAttribute()</code> function, <i>e.g,</i>:

<pre>
  import chimera
  from SimpleSession import registerAttribute
  registerAttribute(chimera.Molecule, "qsarVal")
</pre>
Note that the Define Attribute tool automatically does this registration,
so it's only attributes that you add directly from your own Python code
that need to be registered as above. Also, only attributes whose values 
are recoverable from their <code>repr()</code> can be saved by this mechanism,
so values that are C++ types (Atoms, MaterialColors, <i>etc.</i>) could not
be preserved this way.

<h2>
Restoring and Referring to Special Models
</h2>

<p>
Non-molecular models cannot be located with the <code>sessionID()</code>/
<code>idLookup()</code> mechanism.
Instead, SimpleSession has a <code>modelMap</code> dictionary that can be
used to map between a id/subid tuple for a saved model and the 
actual restored model.
So, during a session save, you would get the tuple to save from a model
with code like:

<pre>
  refToSave = (model.id, model.subid)
</pre>

<p>
The values in <code>modelMap</code> are actually lists of models with
those particular id/subid values, since multiple models may have the
same id/subid (<i>e.g.</i> a molecule and its surface).  So if you are
restoring a special model and want to update <code>modelMap</code>, you
would use code like this:

<pre>
  import SimpleSession
  SimpleSession.modelMap.setdefault(refToSave, []).append(restoredModel)
</pre>

<p>
Keep in mind that the id/subid of the saved model may not be the same as
the restored model, particularly if sessions are being merged.  The key
used by <code>modelMap</code> is always the id/subid of the saved model.

<p>
If you are trying to refer to a non-molecular model using <code>modelMap</code>,
and that non-molecular model is of class <i>X</i>,
you would use code like this:

<pre>
  import SimpleSession
  restoredModel = filter(lambda m: isinstance(m, X), SimpleSession.modelMap[refToSave])[0]
</pre>

<h3>Session Merging</h3>
If you are restoring your own models, you should try to restore them into
their original ids/subids if possible so that scripts and so forth will continue
to work across session saves.  In the case of sessions being merged, this
of course could be problematic.  SimpleSession has a variable
<code>modelOffset</code> (<i>i.e.</i> <code>SimpleSession.modelOffset</code>)
which should be added to your model's id to avoid conflicts
during session merges.
<code>modelOffset</code> is zero during a non-merging session restore.


<h3>Special Molecular/VRML Models</h3>
<p>
Some extensions may create their own Molecule or VRML instances that need to be
restored by the extension itself rather than by the automatic save/restore
for Molecules/VRML provided by SimpleSession.  In order to prevent SimpleSession
from attempting to save the instance, use the
<code>noAutoRestore()</code> function once the instance has been created,
like this:

<pre>
  import SimpleSession
  SimpleSession.noAutoRestore(instance)
</pre>

<p>Your extension is responsible for restoring all aspects of the instance,
including selection state.


<h2>Post-Model Restore</h2>
<p>
If restoring code should be called only after all models have been
restored then the SimpleSession.registerAfterModelsCB routine should be used.
</p>

<pre>
  def afterModelsRestoredCB(arg):
    # do some state restoration now that models have been created

  import SimpleSession
  SimpleSession.registerAfterModelsCB(afterModelsRestoredCB, arg)
</pre>
<p>
The 'arg' can be omitted in both the registration and callback functions.
</p>

<h2>Saving Colors</h2>
<p>
Similar to <code>sessionID</code> for molecular data,
there is <code>colorID</code> function
that returns a value whose <code>repr()</code> can be saved into a session
file. During a restore, that value can be given to
SimpleSession's <code>getColor</code> function to
get a Color object back.
</p>
<h2>Closing a Session</h2>

<p>
The Close Session entry in the Chimera file menu is meant to reset
the state of Chimera, unloading all currently loaded data.  Extensions
can reset their state when the session is closed by handling the
CLOSE_SESSION trigger as illustrated below.
</p>

<font color="red">
<pre>
def closeSession(trigger, a1, a2):
  default_path = '/default/path'
  default_number = 1
  restoreState(default_path, default_number)

import chimera
chimera.triggers.addHandler(chimera.CLOSE_SESSION, closeSession, None)
</pre>
</font>

<h2>Changing Behavior During a Session Restore</h2>

<p>
If an extension needs to behave differently during a session restore
than at other times (<i>e.g.</i> react differently to newly opened models),
then it can register for the BEGIN_RESTORE_SESSION and END_RESTORE_SESSION
triggers, in an analogous manner to the CLOSE_SESSION trigger in the 
preceding section.
</p>

<h2>
Running the Example
</h2>

<p>
To try the example, save the above sections of code shown in red as file
<i>SessionSaveExample.py</i>.
Use the Chimera Favorites/Preferences/Tools/Locations interface to add the directory
where you have placed the file to the extension search path.
Show the Python shell window using the Tools/Programming/IDLE menu
entry and type the following command.
</p>

<pre>
>>> import SessionSaveExample
</pre>

<p>
Now save the session with the File/Save Session As... menu entry
and take a look at the session file in an editor.  You should be able
to find the restoreSessionSaveExample code in the file.  The current value
of the some_path variable can be inspected as follows.
</p>

<pre>
>>> SessionSaveExample.some_path
'/home/smith/tralala.data'
</pre>

<p>
Now close the session with the File/Close Session menu entry and see
that the some_path variable has been reset to the default value.
</p>

<pre>
>>> SessionSaveExample.some_path
'/default/path'
</pre>

<p>
Now reload the session with the File/Open Session menu entry and see
that the some_path variable has been restored.
</p>

<pre>
>>> SessionSaveExample.some_path
'/home/smith/tralala.data'
</pre>
