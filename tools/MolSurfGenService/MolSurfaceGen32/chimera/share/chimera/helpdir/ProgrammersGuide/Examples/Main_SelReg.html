<title>Registering Selectors</title>

<h2>The Selection Manager</h2>

<p>Some extensions may identify sets of Selectables that it would be
useful for other extensions to be able to identify, or for the user to
select from the Selection menu.  For example, the ChemGroup extension
identifies chemical entities such as aromatic rings.  It is useful
to allow other extensions (and the user) to also pick out these entities
without replicating the ChemGroup code.
This is accomplished by registering selections with the Chimera
selection manager.

<p>The Chimera selection manager is defined in
<code>chimera.selection.manager</code>.
Selections are registered with the selection manager
as strings (either Python code or 
<a href="footnotes/OSLsyntax.html">OSL strings</a>)
and are made available
in the Chimera Selection menu.
Selections can (only) be retrieved from the selection manager en masse
as a dictionary organized in the same fashion as the Selection
menu.  The keys in the dictionary are the same as the menu
labels, and the values are either a 2-tuple of the registered
selection string and a help description, or a dictionary
introducing a submenu which is organized the same as the main dictionary.
The <code>selectionFromText</code> method of the selection manager
converts a registered selection string into the appropriate
Selection subclass.

<p><code>chimera.selection.manager</code> also defines
the <b>CodeItemizedSelection</b> class, which is similar
to the <b>CodeSelection</b> class described above, except
that the code is given an empty ItemizedSelection to fill in
instead of functions to apply.

<p>The Python strings registered with the selection manager are expected
to be useable in conjunction with <b>CodeItemizedSelection</b>s.
