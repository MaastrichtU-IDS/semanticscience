The Programmer's Guide is under construction.
</p><p>
A working knowledge of <a href="http://www.python.org">Python</a>
is required for the Programmer's Guide to be useful.  The
<a href="http://docs.python.org/tutorial/index.html"
target="_blank">Python Tutorial</a>
is recommended for programmers who want a quick introduction to Python.
Non-programmers should
consult the <a href="http://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide"
target="_blank">Beginner's Guide to Python</a>
for some suggestions on where to begin.
</p><p>
The Chimera Programmer's Guide main component is an
<a href="Examples/index.html">Examples</a> section demonstrating
various useful Chimera programming interfaces.
There are also <a href="http://plato.cgl.ucsf.edu/trac/chimera/wiki/Scripts">example scripts</a> for performing various tasks
that you may be able to use as a jumping off point for developing your own script.
We recommend starting with the Examples, and then either using
an example script or examining the Chimera source
code for an extension that does something similar to what you want to
do and working from there.  You can also use Chimera's IDLE programming
shell with the dir(obj) and help(obj) functions to find out more about
the attributes and methods of particular objects.  The FAQ (below) can
also be helpful and questions to the
<a href="../feedback.html#developers">chimera-dev mailing list</a>
are usually quickly answered.
<p>
Also provided:
<ul>
<li> an <a href="faq.html">FAQ</a> with brief answers to common 
programming questions
<li> how to create <a href="Reference/surface.html">surface models</a>
<li> Chimera's C++ source code online in the 
<a href="http://plato.cgl.ucsf.edu/trac/chimera/browser/trunk">SVN repository</a>
or 
<a href="http://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/sourcecode.html">packaged for download</a>.
<li>Handouts from the summer 2008 Chimera programming class describing how to
<a href="md-mav.pdf">write MD Movie scripts and custom MultAlign
Viewer headers</a> and detailing the
<a href="resources.pdf">most generically useful molecular data attributes
and Chimera module functions</a>.
<li> a set of
<a href="frameguidelines.html">guidelines</a> for Chimera menu/widget text
