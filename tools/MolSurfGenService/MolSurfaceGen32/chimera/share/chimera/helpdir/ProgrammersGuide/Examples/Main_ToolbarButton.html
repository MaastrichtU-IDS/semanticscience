<h1>Toolbar Buttons </h1>
<p>The toolbar is a user interface component that appears in the main Chimera 
  window, typically on the left-hand side. The purpose of the toolbar is to hold 
  buttons that invoke commonly used functionality (<i>e.g.</i>, displaying protein 
  backbone) and sets of buttons that comprise the entire interface to an extension 
  (<i>e.g.</i>, playing molecular dynamics movies).</p>
<p>There are four items associated with the button: an icon,, a Python function, 
  a short description, and an URL to a full description. The icon is displayed 
  in the button, and determines the size of the button. The Python function is 
  called when the button is pressed. The description appears as balloon help text. 
  The full description is displayed when context help is invoked.</p>
<p>The code below illustrates how to a button on the toolbar. The code <em>must</em> 
  be executed from a file (<i>i.e.</i>, it cannot be typed in via the Python command 
  line in the main Chimera window). The icon associated with the button is an 
  image file named <i>ToolbarButton.tiff</i> in the same directory as the Python 
  source code. The short description is ``Show Main Chain''. The Python function 
  displays protein backbone and hides all other atoms and bonds, and the code 
  in the body of the function is explained in greater detail in <a href="Main_MolecularEditing.html">Molecular 
  Editing Using Python</a>.</p>

<h2>Example <a href="ToolbarButton.py"><i>ToolbarButton.py</i></a></h2>
<p>
Import system modules used in this example.
The regular expression module, <code>re</code>, is used for matching atom names.
The operating system module, <code>os</code>, is used for constructing the icon
file name (see below).<br>
<spacer type="vertical" size=5>
<code>
<font color="red">import re<br></font>
<font color="red">import os<br></font>
</code>
<p>
Import Chimera modules used in this example.
The <code>chimera</code> module is needed to access the molecular data.<br>
<spacer type="vertical" size=5>
<code>
<font color="red">import chimera<br></font>
</code>
<p>
Function <code>mainchain</code> sets the display status of atoms
and requires no arguments.  The body of the function is
identical to the example described in
<a href="MolecularEditing.html">Molecular Editing Using Python</a>.<br>
<spacer type="vertical" size=5>
<code>
<font color="red">def mainchain():<br></font>
</code>
<dl><dd>
<code>
<font color="red">MAINCHAIN = re.compile("^(N|CA|C)$", re.I)<br></font>
<font color="red">for m in chimera.openModels.list(modelTypes=[chimera.Molecule]):<br></font>
</code>
<dl><dd>
<code>
<font color="red">for a in m.atoms:<br></font>
</code>
<dl><dd>
<code>
<font color="red">a.display = MAINCHAIN.match(a.name) != None<br></font>
</code>
</dl>
</dl>
</dl>
<p>
Create a button in the toolbar.
The first argument to <code>chimera.tkgui.app.toolbar.add</code> is the icon,
which is either the path to an image file, or the name of a standard
Chimera icon (which is the base name of an image file found in the
&quot;share/chimera/images&quot; directory in the Chimera installation directory).
In this case, since <code>ToolbarButton.tiff</code> is not an absolute path, the
icon will be looked for under that name in both the current directory
and in the Chimera images directory.
The second argument is the Python function to be called when the button
is pressed (a.k.a., the &quot;callback function&quot;).
The third argument is a short description of what the button does
(used typically as balloon help).
The fourth argument is the URL to a full description.
For this example the icon name is <code>ToolbarButton.tiff</code>;
the Python function is <code>mainchain</code>;
the short description is &quot;Show Main Chain&quot;;
and there is no URL for context help.<br>
<spacer type="vertical" size=5>
<code>
<font color="red">chimera.tkgui.app.toolbar.add('ToolbarButton.tiff', mainchain, 'Show Main Chain', None)<br></font>
</code>
<h2>Code Notes</h2>
<p>The code in this example consists of two portions: defining the actual functionality 
  in function mainchain and presenting an user interface to the functionality. 
  While the example is presented as a single Python source file, there are good 
  reasons for dividing the code into multiple source files and using a Python 
  package instead. The advantages of the latter approach is illustrated in <a href="Main_ExtensionPackage.html">Packaging 
  an Extension</a>.</p>
<h2>Running the Example</h2>
<p>The example code must be saved in a disk file named <code><i>ToolbarButton.py</i></code> 
  (note that the <i>.py</i> extension is required).  The
  <a href="ToolbarButton.tiff">icon tiff file</a> must
  be save to a file named 'ToolbarButton.tiff' in the same directory.
  Chimera may be then invoked 
  with the code file name on the command line, <i>e.g.</i>,</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><code>chimera ToolbarButton.py</code></p>
</blockquote>
