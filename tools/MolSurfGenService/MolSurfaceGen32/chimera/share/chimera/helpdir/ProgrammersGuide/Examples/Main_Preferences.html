<h1>Preferences</h1>
<p>Preferences are settings that are to remembered across invocations of
Chimera.  Preferences are organized into categories (<i>e.g.</i>
&quot;General&quot; or &quot;Midas&quot;).  Extension writers needing
preference functionality will generally create a category named for
their extension to save and retrieve preferences from.

<p>The preference panel found under the Chimera &quot;Tools&quot; menu
is intended for only the broadest and most general categories of
preferences.  Though extensions could easily add their preference
categories to this panel, it is expected that in order to keep the
category list in the panel to a reasonable size, extensions will offer
access to their preference category separately.
The Chimera preference mechanism makes it simple implement an interface
to a preference category.

<h2>Basic Concepts</h2>
tkoptions
creating a category
adding options to a category
getting/setting option values

<p>The Selection class (and its subclasses) is used to manage collections
of items derived from class Selectable.  Molecules, Residues, Atoms, and
Bonds are all derived from Selectable.
The examples given will use these common Selectables for
simplicity, but one should keep in mind that classes such as Model and
PseudoBond are also Selectables and can be managed with Selections.

<p>An important thing to understand is that a Selection is not necessarily
a fixed set of Selectables.  It may encapsulate an algorithm for choosing
particular Selectables.  For example, a Selection may be used to hold
&quot;all bonds/atoms in aromatic rings in all models&quot;.
This Selection, when its contents are queried,
would return differing results as models are opened/closed.

<p>Every Selectable has an associated
<i>selection level</i>:
<ul>
	<li>SelGraph (<i>e.g.</i>Molecule)
	<li>SelSubgraph (<i>e.g.</i>Residue)
	<li>SelVertex (<i>e.g.</i>Atom)
	<li>SelEdge (<i>e.g.</i>Bond)
</ul>
Any Selectable's selection level is returned by its 
<a href="footnotes/osl.html">osl</a>Level() member function. 

<p>Selections typically only explicitly hold vertices and edges.
Higher-level Selectables' (graphs/subgraphs) membership in a Selection
is computed from member vertices/edges.
Selection methods that enumerate graphs can do so based on that graph's
vertices/edges either being completely or partially present in the
selection, as desired.
Inclusion of graphs that have no vertex or edge sub-components (such as
VRML models) is explicity tracked in a selection.

<p>Since a Selection may encapsulate an algorithm for choosing Selectables,
or instead may hold a specific set of Selectables,
there is no method in the class
Selection for specifying the items held in the Selection.  Therefore,
Selection is only used as a base class and all actual selections use
subclasses.  The basic subclasses Chimera defines in
<code>chimera.selection</code> are the following:

<p><b>ItemizedSelection</b>:  holds a fixed set of Selectables.  However,
Selectables <i>will</i> be deleted from the selection when the model(s)
containing those Selectables are closed.  Therefore, sometimes it is
convenient to use an ItemizedSelection to track atoms, <i>etc.</i>, 
just to avoid having to write trigger-handling code yourself.

<p><b>OrderedSelection</b>:  subclass of ItemizedSelection.  Used in the
infrequent case where the ordering of the Selectables is important
(<i>e.g.</i> structure matching).  Ordering is only maintained relative to
Selectables at the same selection level.

<p><b>OSLSelection</b>:  holds Selectables based on an OSL string.
&quot;OSL&quot; stands for Object Selection Language, and a rundown of
OSL syntax can be found <a href="footnotes/OSLsyntax.html">here</a>.
Whenever Selectables are requested from an OSLSelection, the OSL string
will be re-evaluated to obtain the matching Selectables.  Therefore,
if the string contains an attribute test, it may return different Selectables
at different times.

<p><b>CodeSelection</b>:  uses a Python code string to determine what is
selected.  The code is expected to apply functions (provided as local
variables) to selected objects.

<p>In addition to these classes,
<code>chimera.selection</code>
has many functions for manipulating
the current selection shown in the Chimera graphics display.

<p>The code below demonstrates how to use a selection to hold the
atoms/bonds of the protein mainchain, and then highlight them in
the main Chimera graphics window.

Define a regular expression for matching the names of protein backbone

<p>
The <code>list</code> method of chimera.openModels will return a list of
currently open models, and takes several optional keyword arguments
to restrict this list to models matching certain criteria.
When called with no arguments, this method will
return a list of all visible models, essentially models that
were created by the user. Internally managed (<code>hidden</code>) models,
such as the distance monitor pseudobondgroup, do not show up in this
list. A list of hidden models can be obtained by setting the
optional keyword argument <code>hidden</code> to True.
The <code>all</code> argument (True/False) can be used to return a list of all open models
(including both hidden and visible). Other optional arguments include:<p>
<code>id</code> and <code>subid</code>, which restrict the returned list to models with the given
id and subid, respectively, while <code>modelTypes</code> (a list of model types,
i.e. <code>[chimera.Molecule]</code>) will restrict the returned list to models
of a particular type.<br>

<p>
Create a selection instance that we can use to hold the protein
backbone atoms.  We could have added the atoms one by one to the
selection while we were in the above loop, but it is more efficient
to add items in bulk to selections if possible.<br>
<spacer type="vertical" size=5>
<code>
<font color="red">backboneSel = selection.ItemizedSelection()<br></font>
<font color="red">backboneSel.add(bbAtoms)<br></font>
</code>
<p>
Add the connecting bonds to the selection.  The <code>addImplied</code> method
of Selection adds bonds if both bond endpoint atoms are in the
selection, and adds atoms if any of the atom's bonds are in the
selection.  We use that method here to add the connecting bonds.<br>
<spacer type="vertical" size=5>
<code>
<font color="red">backboneSel.addImplied()<br></font>
</code>
<p>
Change the selection in the main Chimera window in the manner
indicated by this function's <code>op</code> keyword argument. If op is
<code>None</code>, then use whatever method is indicated by the <code>Selection Mode</code>
item in Chimera's Select menu.  Otherwise, op should
be one of: <code>selection.REPLACE</code>, <code>selection.INTERSECT</code>,
<code>selection.EXTEND</code> or <code>selection.REMOVE</code>.<dl compact><dd>
<dl compact>
<dt>-<dd>
<code>REPLACE</code> causes the Chimera selection to be replaced with
<code>backboneSel</code>.<dt>-<dd>
<code>INTERSECT</code> causes the Chimera selecion to be intersected
with <code>backboneSel</code>.<dt>-<dd>
<code>EXTEND</code> causes <code>backboneSel</code> to be appended to the Chimera
selection.<dt>-<dd>
<code>REMOVE</code> causes <code>backboneSel</code> to be unselected in the
Chimera window.</dl>

<h2>Code Notes</h2>
<p>See the <a href="Main_SelReg.html">Registering Selectors</a> example for
how to make the &quot;selBackbone&quot; function available from the Chimera Select menu.
<h2>Running the Example</h2>
<p>The example code files must be saved in a directory named <code><i>BackboneSel</i></code>. 
  To run the example, start <i>chimera</i> in the directory <em>above the package 
  directory</em> and type the following commands into the <a href="../../ContributedSoftware/idle/idle.html">IDLE</a> command line:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><code>import BackboneSel</code></p>
  <p><code>BackboneSel.selBackbone()</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This will cause the selection state of all protein backbone atoms to
change, depending on the Selection Mode chosen in the Chimera Select menu.
If the mode is the default (&quot;replace&quot;),
then the protein backbone will
become selected and all other atoms/bonds will become deselected.
