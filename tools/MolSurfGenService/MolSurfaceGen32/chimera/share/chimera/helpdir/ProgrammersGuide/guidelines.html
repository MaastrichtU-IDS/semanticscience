<h1>Chimera Menu/Widget Text Guidelines</h1>

<!--
At the Chimera meeting (03/21/02), there was general agreement
on the font, basic menu scheme, and usage of ellipses.  Guidelines
for widgets were developed taking into consideration Microsoft 
and Macintosh user interface text guidelines and the existing
Chimera interfaces.
-->

<h2>I. Goals</h2>
<ul>
<li>to promote consistent text usage in Chimera's user interfaces
<li>to provide guidelines for developers and programmers
<li>to promote awareness and discussion
</ul>

<a name="font">
<h2>II. Font</h2>
</a>
<p>
The default font type and size should be used.
</p>

<a name="menus">
<h2>III. Menus</h2>
</a>
<h3>IIIa. General Scheme</h3>
<p>
<pre>
<b>Primary</b> (one word, noun or verb, capitalized)
  <b>Secondary</b> (words capitalized as in a title)
    <b>tertiary or lower</b> (numeral or lowercase,
                       except proper nouns) 
</pre>
Proper nouns include atom types, elements, and extension (tool) names.
</p><p>
Examples:
</p>
<pre>
<b>Select
  Chemistry
    element
      other
        Fe-Hg
          Fe</b>
          (etc.)
  <b>Residue
    amino acid category
      aliphatic</b>
      (etc.)
  <b>Selection Mode (replace)
    append</b>
    (etc.)
<b>Actions
  Atoms/Bonds
    wire width
      1</b>
      (etc.)
  <b>Ribbon
    show</b>
    (etc.)
<b>Tools
  Utilities
    Browser Configuration</b>
    (etc.)
</pre>

<h3>IIIb. Usage of Ellipses</h3>
</a>
<p>
The ellipsis string "..." should indicate
a menu item that opens an additional interface which requires
user input to accomplish the function described by its name
(one-shot panels, as opposed to those intended
to be left up for a series of user interactions).
For now, <b>Tools</b> are exempted from this guideline.
<p>
We decided that "..." should not indicate
a menu item which simply opens an additional interface, since
practically all items would then require it.
</p><p>
There also needs to be consistency in whether "..." is preceded by a space;
we recommend no space.
</p><p>
Finally, should "..." appear on buttons as well as menu items?  If so,
the same criteria should apply.
</p>

<h2>IV. Widgets (GUIs)</h2>
</a>
<p>
This is the broadest grouping, and thus less amenable to standardization.
It includes panels and dialog boxes generated by built-in functions
as well as extensions to Chimera.  General recommendations:
</p>
  <ul>
  <li><b>Title of Widget</b>
  <br>- one or more words to appear on the top bar, capitalized as a title,
  no colon or period at the end; should be the same text as the invoking
  menu item or button (except sans any <a href="#menudots">"..."</a>)
  <li><b>Brief Header</b> for a section
  <br>- capitalized as a title, optional colon at the end (but no colon
  when sections are treated as "index cards")
  <li><b>Longer description of a section</b>
  <br>- first word capitalized, subsequent words not capitalized
  unless proper nouns or acronyms; optional colon at the end, no period
  <li><b>Instructive statement</b>
  <br>- first word capitalized, subsequent words not capitalized
  unless proper nouns or acronyms; no period
  <br>Example:
  <br><b>Ctrl-click on histogram to add or delete thresholds</b>
  in the <b>Volume Viewer Display</b> panel
  <li><b>[box] Description next to a checkbox</b>
  <br>- first word capitalized, subsequent words not capitalized
  unless proper nouns or acronyms; no period or question mark
    <ul>
    <li>exception:  when the checkbox indicates a section
    to be expanded/compacted, the text may be capitalized as a title
    (instead of only the first word being capitalized).
    </ul>
  <li><b>Item name: [blank, color well, slider, pulldown menu or
  checkbox list]</b>
  <br><i>or</i>
  (especially if there are many of these in the widget)
  <br><b>item name: [blank, color well, slider, pulldown menu or
  checkbox list]</b>
  <br>- first word of item name optionally capitalized,
  subsequent words not capitalized unless proper nouns or acronyms;
  colon separating the item name from the value(s);
  options in a pulldown menu or checkbox list not capitalized unless
  proper nouns or acronyms
    <ul>
    <li>exception:  when the item name and pulldown option together
    describe a section, both should be capitalized and the colon is optional
    <br>Examples:
    <br><b>Inspect [Atom</b>/etc.] in the <b>Selection Inspector</b>
    <br><b>Category: [New Molecules</b>/etc.] in the <b>Preferences Tool</b>
    </ul>
  <li><b>Phrase with [blank, color well, pulldown menu, or checkbox list]
  embedded</b>
  <br>- first word capitalized, no colon, period or question mark;
  the blank (etc.) should not start the phrase
  <li><b>Phrase with [button] embedded</b>
  <br>- 1-2 words actually on the button, others trailing and/or preceding;
  the first word should be capitalized whether or not on the button; no
  colon, period or question mark; the button may start the phrase
  <li>buttons marked <b>OK</b>, <b>Apply</b>, <b>Cancel</b>, <b>Help</b>
  <br>- common but optional
  <li>widget-specific buttons
  <br>- 1-2 words, each capitalized if the button brings up another panel,
  at least the first word capitalized otherwise; if another panel is evoked,
  consider using <a href="#menudots">"..."</a>
  </ul>
