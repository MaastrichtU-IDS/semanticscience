<h1>RGBA tuples</h1>
<p>RGBA tuples are 4-tuples where the respective tuple components
represent red, green, blue, and alpha (opacity) values for a color.
Each value is a floating point number between 0.0 and 1.0.
  For example, the 
  tuple (1, 0, 0, 1) represents an opaque red, while (0, 1, 0, 0.5) represents 
  a half transparent green.
