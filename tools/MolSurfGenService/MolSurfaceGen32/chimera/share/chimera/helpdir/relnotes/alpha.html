    <h2>Chimera Alpha Release Notes</h2>

    <h3>Alpha version 1.0 Build <a name="1389">1389</a></h3>
    <blockquote><p>
      Changes from the <a href="#1351">previous release</a>:
      <ul>
	<li>Revised Open/Save dialogs for a consistent UI with more functionality
	<li>New set of 60 colors available from the <b>Actions</b> menu and
	the command line
	<li>"Latest Version?" <b>Help</b> menu item
	<li><b>Volume Viewer</b> 5-10x faster isosurface rendering (surface or mesh)
	<li><b>Volume Path Tracer</b> documentation integrated with the User's Guide
	<li><b>SimpleSession</b> can save to an arbitrary name
	<li><b>Menu Functions</b> tutorial
	<li>Automatic stereo video switching for SGI IRIX workstations
	<li>Fixed resizing bug in <b>PDB Preferences</b> dialog
	<li>Fixed <b>ViewDock</b> bug 
	<li>Fixed <b>Model Panel</b> column configuration bug 
	<li>Fixed <b>FindHBond</b> failure for structures with double-bonded non-ring nitrogens
      </ul>
      <p>
      Known bugs/workarounds:
      <ul>
	<li>On Windows 98 (only), Chimera bombs on start-up due to a problem with
	the preferences-saving mechanism.
	You can fix this by downloading
	<a href="base.py">this python file</a>
	and replacing the following file with it: &lt;where you installed Chimera&gt;
	-&gt; share -&gt; chimera -&gt; preferences -&gt; base.py
	<br>If you chose the default when installing, then
	&quot;where you installed Chimera&quot; is C:\Program Files\chimera.
	Even with this fixed file, Chimera will be unable to store preferences
	on Windows 98.
	You can work around this by going to the Chimera Settings
	menu and choosing "Preferences" from it.  This will bring up a preferences
	window with a menu button near the top.  Press the menu button and choose
	Preferences on it.  The window will change so that a menu button labeled
	&quot;Location:&quot; is shown.  Change the menu button so that 
	&quot;preferences&quot; is selected.  Chimera should then be able to
	save preferences.  Preferences are used not only to store the user
	preferences set from the Settings -&gt; Preferences menu item,
	but to store such things as the directory history used by Chimera's
	File -&gt; Open... dialog, so while it is not absolutely necessary to
	apply this workaround, it is very desirable to do so.
	<li>Problems with the <b>Page Setup</b>, <b>Window Setup</b>,
	and <b>Print Panel</b> remain.  In particular, changing settings in
	these panels will cause problems in saved preferences, and subsequent
	Chimera sessions will abort on start up.
	To get past the start-up problem,
	you need to remove your preferences file (or, if you know what you're
	doing, edit the preferences file to remove the print panel preferences).
	The preferences file is kept in the '.chimera'
	subdirectory of your home directory (and is named 'preferences').
	On Windows, you will have to use the <b>Find</b> item on your
	<b>Start</b> menu to find the '.chimera' folder.
	<li>Not all Open/Save dialogs converted to new style
	<li>Sessions saved in the previous version will not restore completely
	correctly in this version (and you will see an error message).
	In particular, the clipping plane positions
	and the center of view will not be restored.  You can adjust the clipping
	planes manually with the SideView widget (in the Controllers menu)
	after restoring the session.  If it is critical to get the center of view
	restored, you can edit the old session (it's a regular text file) as
	follows:  near the end of the file (about 16 lines from the end) is a line
	that contains
	<tt>curNear = camera.near</tt>;
	delete that line and all the following lines up to and including the line
	<tt>del cameraAttrs[&quot;far&quot;]</tt> (about 5 from the end);
	save the edited file.  The edited session will restore the center of view
	correctly but the clipping planes will still have to be manually positioned.
	<li>Color names typed to the color editor use the Tk version of the color,
	rather than the Chimera version.
	<li>Closing the Sequence panel (invoked via the &quot;sequence...&quot;
	button of the Model panel) will cause many errors in any selection operation
	afterward.  Until the next release, the workaround is to not close the
	Sequence panel during a Chimera session.
	<li>On SGIs, switching from stereo to mono does not switch the video mode.
	<li>On Windows systems, if the last directory a file was opened from in a
	previous Chimera session no longer exists when a new session is started,
	no open/save panels will work (this typically happens when the directory
	was on removable media, or was a network drive that is no longer mapped).
	To get Chimera open/save panels to work again, you either have to edit
	your Chimera preferences file, or make the non-existent directory 
	available again.  To find your preferences file, use the <b>Find</b>
	item on your Windows <b>Start</b> menu.  Look for a folder named
	<i>.chimera</i> (this could take a few minutes).  In that folder is
	a file named <i>preferences</i> which you can either remove, or edit
	with whatever text editor you are comfortable with.  If you edit it,
	look for a line that contains the word <tt>dirHistory</tt>.  There
	should be a non-existent single-quoted directory path in that same line.
	Change the directory path to one that exists (using two backslashes
	instead of one between path components).  Save the file and Chimera
	open/save panels should then work.
      </ul>

	<a href="Compound.py">this python file</a>
	and replacing the following file with it: &lt;where you installed chimera&gt;
	-&gt; share -&gt; ViewDock -&gt; Compound.py
