  <h2>UCSF Chimera Version 1.0 Build 2540 Release Notes (9 July 2008)</h2>

  <h3>
   Changes since the <a href="1.2470.html">previous production release (1.0 build 2470)</a>:
  </h3>

  <blockquote>
   <h4>General:</h4>
   <ul type=None>

     <li><p>Data Files</p>
     <ul>
    <li><b>CASTp</b> &mdash; new fetch type CASTp retrieves a structure and 
    associated precomputed pocket measurements from the 
    Computed Atlas of Surface Topography of proteins
    <li><b>PubChem</b>  &mdash; new fetch type PubChem compound identifier (CID) 
    retrieves a 3D structure from the Pub3D database provided by the
    Chemical Informatics and
    Cyberinfrastructure Collaboratory (CICC) at Indiana University
    <li><b>SMILES</b>  &mdash; new command-line fetch type SMILES returns a 3D structure
    generated by the <i>smi23d</i> Web service provided by the 
    Chemical Informatics and 
    Cyberinfrastructure Collaboratory (CICC) at Indiana University
    <li> <b>ModBase</b>  &mdash; fetch type ModBase retrieves comparative models and
    shows associated information in a dialog
    <li>Mulliken charges in Gaussian formatted checkpoint input files
    are read and assigned as atom attributes
    <li><b>POV-Ray Options</b> "keep files" preference is now false by default
    and honored (whether true or false) during movie recording
    <li><b>Rotamers + Attributes</b>  &mdash; sessions include the state of Rotamers and attributes
    that were created with Define Attribute or defattr
    <li><b>Session Files</b>  &mdash; in session files, most very long lines are now broken into shorter lines
    <li><b>Wavefront OBJ</b>  &mdash; can export Wavefront OBJ format (surfaces only, untransformed)
     </ul>

     <li><p>Surfaces</p>
     <ul>
    <li><b>Surface Areas</b> &mdash; analytical solvent-accessible and solvent-excluded surface areas 
    (total and per disconnected component) are reported in the Reply Log when
    molecular surface is generated; atom and residue surface area attributes 
    <i>areaSAS</i> and <i>areaSES</i> are automatically assigned
    <li><b>Surface Display Settings</b> &mdash; more attributes of surface models and their constituent
    surface pieces are exposed in the <i>Selection Inspector</i> and surface
    model attributes panel
    <li><b>Surface Operations</b> &mdash; <i>Actions</i> menu applies to surface selections
    <li><b>Surface Commands</b> &mdash; more operations work on molecular surfaces 
    (<i>mask</i> command, <i>Color Zone</i>, etc.)
    now that they are a specialized subtype of surface model
      <li><b>Faster Rendering</b>  &mdash; opaque surfaces drawn up to 4 times
      faster using OpenGL vertex buffer objects.  Transparent surfaces are not
      any faster.
     </ul>

     <li><p>Appearance</p>
     <ul>
    <li><b>Default Zoom</b> &mdash; larger default scale (initial appearance and after 
    <i>reset</i> to default position, <i>focus</i>, or <i>window</i> is used)
    <li><b>POV-Ray lighting</b> &mdash; default lighting changed to improve raytracing results
    (differences in Chimera are subtle)
    <li><b>Atom Colors</b>  &mdash; limited color-by-element scheme expanded to a periodic table of colors
    <li><b>Ribbon-Inside Color</b> &mdash; helix ribbon interior can be colored separately from the exterior
    <li><b>Residue Labels</b> &mdash; custom residue labeling can include any residue attribute
    <li><b>Dashed Bonds</b>  &mdash; dot/dash line controls simplified (in molecule model and pseudobond 
    group attributes panels)
    <li><b>Field of View</b> &mdash; field of view controls changed: auto-adjusting, uneditable "window 
    width" replaced with constant (but editable) "screen width" in
      <I>Camera</I>, image-saving panel allows using image width instead of 
    screen width to calculate image field of view, moving focal plane
    in <i>Top View</i> no longer changes distance to screen and field of view
    <li><b>Fonts</b> &mdash; provide a copy of the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/freefont/">Free UCS Outline Fonts</a> for use in labels
     </ul>

     <li><p>User Interface</p>
     <ul>
    <li><b>Native Mac Interface</b>  &mdash; Many bugs fixed
       in Mac version that uses the native Mac user interface Aqua instead
       of X windows.
    <li><b>Non-Graphical Interface</b> &mdash; if Chimera is started with <i>--nogui</i> and without script file input,
    a prompt is supplied in the system shell for entering commands 
    on standard input
    <li><b>Startup Messages</b>  &mdash; new startup option --silent to suppress all messages except from
    print statements
    <li><b>Command History</b>  &mdash; mistyped commands are now included in the command history 
    (allows easier correction by editing)
    <li><b>SpaceNavigator</b>  &mdash; 6 degree-of-freedom input device supported on Mac and Windows 
    <li><b>Actions / Target</b> &mdash; seldom used menu removed
   </ul>

     <li><p>Programming</p>
      <ul>
    <li><b>Python</b>  &mdash; Chimera now uses an unmodifed Python 2.5 binary,
    so it is possible to import Chimera's dynamic libraries into other Pythons
      </ul>
