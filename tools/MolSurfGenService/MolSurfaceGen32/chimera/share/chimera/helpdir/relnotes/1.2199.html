    <h2>UCSF Chimera Version 1.0 Build 2199 Release Notes (17 February 2006)</h2>

    <h3>
      Changes since the <a href="1.2184.html">previous production release (1.0 build 2184)</a>:
    </h3>

    <blockquote>

      <h4>General:</h4>
      <ul>

	<li>uses new PDB web interface for fetching PDB files
	(older chimera's will fail starting sometime after June 2006)

	<li>can write out Mol2 files (File... Save Mol2)

	<li>new input format, BILD: simple descriptions of lines, polygons,
	and basic geometric forms are used to make a VRML model in Chimera
	(was available earlier but mostly undocumented)

	<li>new format for atomic coordinates: XYZ

	<li>new volume formats: Gaussian cube grid, Purdue image format,
	Situs map file

      </ul>

      <h4>New Tools:</h4>
      <ul>

	<li><b>Angles/Torsions</b> (Structure Analysis) &mdash;
	table of angle monitors, analogous to the Distances panel

	<li><b>Dock Prep</b> (Surface Binding/Analysis) &mdash;
	perform several tasks to prepare structures for use with DOCK
	(or other programs): delete solvent, add hydrogens, load charges,
	write as Mol2

	<li><b>Fit Models in Maps</b> (Volume Data) &mdash;
	locally optimize the fit of a structure within a density map

	<li><b>Icosahedron Surface</b> (Higher-Order Structure) &mdash;
	create a hybrid icosahedron/sphere surface

	<li><b>Intersurf</b> (Surface Binding/Analysis) &mdash;
	generate and display interface surfaces
	(was available earlier but undocumented)

	<li><b>Measure Volume</b> (Volume Data) &mdash;
	measure the volume enclosed in a surface

	<li><b>Set Bond Length</b> (Structure Editing) &mdash;
	set lengths of selected bonds arbitrarily

	<li><b>Volume Eraser</b> (Volume Data) &mdash;
	interactively zero out parts of volume data

      </ul>

      <h4>Tool Changes:</h4>
      <ul>

	<li><b>AddH</b> (moved to Structure Editing) &mdash;
	deletes lone pairs and unidentifiable-element atoms;
	uses Amber parm99 bond lengths for X-H (X=C/N/O/S)

	<li><b>Adjust Torsions</b> also moved to Structure Editing category

	<li><b>Color Zone</b> (Volume Data) &mdash;
	colors to match the closest atom rather than any atom within the cutoff

	<li><b>Effects</b> (Viewing Controls) &mdash;
	silhouette edges can be drawn to highlight borders and discontinuities

	<li><b>Match->Align</b> (Structure Comparison) &mdash;
	default cutoff 5.0 angstroms

	<li><b>MatchMaker</b> (Structure Comparison) &mdash;
	default iteration cutoff 2.0 angstroms;
	added option to calculate secondary structure assignments
	prior to matching (on by default)

	<li><b>Multalign Viewer</b> (Structure Comparison) &mdash;
	Ctrl-arrow editing shifts the active region rather than the last-drawn;
	gap columns can be added on the ends;
	Copy/Rename buttons on Region Browser;
	percent identity calculation (Tools... Percent Identity);
	can load custom residue letter coloring schemes
	(Tools... Load Color Scheme);
	Structure Match default iteration cutoff 2.0 angstroms

	<li><b>Multiscale Models</b> (Higher-Order Structure) &mdash;
	setting Resolution to 0 triggers calculation of solvent-excluded
	molecular surface instead of the usual low-resolution surface

	<li><b>Surface Color</b> (Volume Data) &mdash;
	can use up to 20 colors (previously 5);
	can use preset rainbow, grayscale, and red-white-blue color patterns

      </ul>

      <h4>New Tutorial:</h4>

      <ul>
	<li>Trajectory and Ensemble Analysis
	<li>other tutorials updated
      </ul>

      <h4>Major Bugs Fixed:</h4>
      <ul>
	<li>eliminated several memory leaks (some remain in third-party code)
	<li>off-by-one MD Movie/recording fixed
	<li>transforms in BILD format now work correctly
      </ul>

      <h4>Known Bugs:</h4>
      <ul>
	<li>POV-ray output is missing boxes and cones, so Nucleotide
	representations are not visible.  The workaround is to use RenderMan
	output and a RenderMan renderer, like the freely available one
	from <a href="http://www.3delight.com/">3delight</a>.  This is fixed
	in the next release.
	<li>On Windows, the POV-ray and RenderMan exporters fail due to a
	missing dll.  The fix is to copy CHIMERA/bin/zlib.dll
	to CHIMERA/bin/zlib1.dll so that both exist.  This is also fixed in
	the next release.
	<li>bond rotations in large molecules are slow 
	<li>ribbon transparency doesn't work correctly on all platforms
	<li>cross-eye stereo parallax is wrong
	<li>surfaces fail for some structures
      </ul>
