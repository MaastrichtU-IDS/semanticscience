    <h3>Chimera Beta Version 1.0 Build 1442 Release Notes (10 April 2002)</h3>
    <blockquote><p>
      Changes from the <a href="1.1430.html">previous release</a>:
      <ul>
	<li>Upgrade to Python 2.1.2 <a href="embedded.html">and many other packages</a>.
	<li>Linux problems with NVIDIA drivers fixed (graphics would disappear and sometimes hang).
	<li>Linux problems with KDE window manager fixed (really slow bond rotation dialog updating).
	<li>Fixed bug that broke stereo code on Windows.
	<li>Improved volume viewer (handle little-endian MRC files, use new Open/Save dialog, open volumes files from main Chimera open dialog, and more).
	<li>Fixed bug with the active color well not updating.
	<li>Fixed bug that prevented adjacent bonds from being rotated.
	<li>Add back "lost" icons in mouse modes preferences dialog.
	<li>Documentation updated.
      </ul>
      <p>
      Known bugs/workarounds:
      <ul>
	<li>Must use Chimera's Python on Linux even though the system version passes our compatibility tests.
	<li>Not all Open/Save dialogs have been converted to the new style.
	<li>VRML Materials are picking up the emissive color for the diffuse and
	ambient components (due to an OpenGL coding bug).
	This is fixed in the next release.
	<li>Problems with the <b>Page Setup</b>, <b>Window Setup</b>,
	and <b>Print Panel</b> remain.
	<li>On IRIX 6.5.15 and later, Chimera may not run due to a runtime linker
	failure.  This is fixed in the next release.  No workaround is known.
	<li>On some Linux systems (Debian only?),
	there are conflicts between chimera's Tcl/Tk libraries and the system ones.
	A workaround is to add a couple of symbolic links in the lib directory
	of the chimera installation:
	<blockquote><pre><code>
% cd ..../chimera/lib
% ln -s libtk8.3.so libtk8.3.so.1
% ln -s libtcl8.3.so libtcl8.3.so.1
	</code></pre></blockquote>
      </ul>
