    <li>start-of-line aliases (defined with <b>alias ^</b><i>name</i>) now
    available from top-level <b>Aliases</b> menu
    <li>selection broadening/narrowing cascades now include "nothing,"
    one level narrower than the original selection
    <li>Mol2 files can be written with Amber/GAFF atom types
   (from <b>Add Charge</b>) instead of Sybyl atom types
    <li><b>Selector Construction Panel</b> removed
   </ul>

   <h4>Tool Changes:</h4>
   <ul>

    <li><b>2D Labels</b> (Utilities) &mdash; 
    2D labels can be written to and read from a file

    <li><b>Add Charge</b> (Structure Analysis, Structure Editing) &mdash; 
    added option to show partial charges as labels
  
    <li><b>Distances</b>, <b>Angles/Torsions</b> (Structure Analysis) &mdash; 
    <ul>
     <li>added option to select the corresponding atoms/bonds 
     when a measurement is chosen in the table
     <li>angle monitors saved in sessions
    </ul>

    <li><b>Find Clashes/Contacts</b> 
    (Structure Analysis, Surface/Binding Analysis) &mdash; 
    allows checking for interactions between two independently designated 
    sets of atoms (not just a designated set against itself or all other atoms)

    <li><b>MD Movie</b> (MD/Ensemble Analysis) &mdash; 
     can read trajectory from multiple XYZ files, one per frame

    <li><b>Multalign Viewer</b> (Sequence) &mdash; 
    <ul>

    coloring section removed

    <li><b>Thermal Ellipsoids</b> (Structure Analysis) &mdash; 
    <ul>
     <li>depictions saved in sessions
     <li>possible depictions include ellipsoid principal axes 
     and/or principal ellipses in addition to the ellipsoids themselves
     <li>includes <b>Presets</b> menu for rapid access to

   <h4>New Commands:</h4>
   <ul>
    <li><b>command</b> &mdash; description
   </ul>
   -->

   <h4>Command Changes:</h4>
   <ul>
    <li><b>angle</b> &mdash; can measure angles between axes and/or planes
    <li><b>aniso</b> &mdash; added options for display of thermal ellipsoid 
    principal axes and/or principal ellipses
    <li><b>distance</b> &mdash; can measure distances involving axes 
    and/or planes
    <li><b>findclash</b> &mdash; 
    allows checking for interactions between two independently specified 
    sets of atoms (not just a specified set against itself or all other atoms)
    <li><b>shape</b> &mdash; can generate ellipsoids, 
      apply specified rotations to shapes
    <li>redundant commands removed: <b>load</b>, <b>source</b>, <b>rescolor</b>,
    <b>resrepr</b>, <b>x3dsave</b>, <b>brotation</b>, <b>push</b>, <b>pop</b>  


   </ul>

   <h4>Known Bugs:</h4>
   <ul>
    <li>Mac OS 10.5 / X11 problems:
       <ul>
       <li> sometimes display does not update
       (can be forced by slightly moving the view contents with the mouse)
       <li> sometimes saved images have a corrupt or "mis-tiled" appearance.
        Workarounds to try include:
         <ul>
         <li>showing the <b>Command Line</b> if it is not shown 
        (or if it is shown, hiding it) and then re-saving the image
         <li>saving the position with command <b>savepos</b>, jiggling
         the view with the mouse, restoring the position with <b>reset</b>,
         and then re-saving the image
         <li>saving a session, restoring the session in the Mac Aqua
         version of Chimera, and then re-saving the image
         </ul>
        </ul>
     <li>surfaces fail for some structures
     <li>POV-Ray incorrectly renders some of the characters in the fonts
     Chimera uses, especially the zero
   </ul>
