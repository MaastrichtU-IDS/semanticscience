	<li>In the <b>User's Guide</b>, individual command manual pages

      </ul>
      <p>
      Known bugs/workarounds:
      <ul>
	<li>Chimera Linux installations using GeForce2-based graphics cards with the
	latest NVidia drivers (2802) have severe problems displaying molecules.
	We are working on a fix.  The only workaround currently is to back up to an
	earlier version of the drivers.
	<li>Not all Open/Save dialogs have been converted to the new style.
	<li>Problems with the <b>Page Setup</b>, <b>Window Setup</b>,
	and <b>Print Panel</b> remain.
	<li>StructMeasure won't start from the Extension manager.
	Start it from the <b>Controllers</b> menu instead
	(the <b>Distances</b> or <b>Adjust Torsions</b> menu entries).
      </ul>
