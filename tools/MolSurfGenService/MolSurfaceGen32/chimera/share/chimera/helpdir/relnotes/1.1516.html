    <h3>Chimera Beta Version 1.0 Build 1516 Release Notes (3 July 2002)</h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
      Changes from the <a href="1.1442.html">previous release</a>:
      <ul>
	<li><b>SimpleSession</b> is now connected to session-saving options
	under the <b>File</b> menu and can save the status of some extensions
	(<b>Volume Viewer</b>, <b>Volume Path Tracer</b>, and <b>Scale Bar</b>)!
	<li>New extensions:
	<ul>
	  <li><b>Multalign Viewer</b> -- manipulate multiple sequence alignments.
	  <li><b>Accelerators</b> -- use and define keyboard shortcuts.
	  <li><b>Scale Bar</b> -- draw a scale bar and associated label.
	  <li><b>Phantom</b> -- use a Phantom force feedback device to place markers in
	  volume data.
	</ul>
	<li>Improved extensions:
	<ul>
	  <li>Filtering by H-bonds with <b>ViewDock</b>.
	  <li><b>Volume Viewer</b> can show solid display "maximum intensity projection".
	  <li><b>Volume Path Tracer</b> has minor interface rearrangements.
	</ul>
	<li>Redesigned image-saving procedure (<b>File... Save Image...</b>)
	<li>New "united atom" VDW radii based on the ProtOr set and ionic radii
	from the Handbook of Chemistry and Physics.
	<li>Status line and associated preference (<b>Messages</b> category).
	<li>Preference for open/save dialog start directory (<b>General</b> category).
	<li><b>Help</b> menu reorganized.
	<li>Menu and widget text standardized (capitalization/punctuation).
	<li>New "Model Panel and Ensembles" tutorial (<b>User's Guide</b>).
	<li>Many documentation improvements.
	<li>Fixed bug that disallowed rotation of adjacent torsions.
	<li>Fixed bug with VRML material that caused VRML models to be black.
	<li>Adjust sphere and cylinder subdivisions with screen size to improve
	graphics response and visual quality.
	<li>Upgraded to Python 2.2.1 <a href="embedded.html">and other packages</a>.
	<li>Added workaround for IRIX 6.5.16's "unresolvable symbol in /usr/lib32/libumf.so: xfree".
      </ul>
      <p>
      Known bugs/workarounds:
      <ul>
	<li>This release crashes on Mandrake 8.2 Linux.
	The only known workaround is to upgrade
	to Mandrake 9 (currently in beta), which Chimera does runs on.
	<li>On some Linux systems (Debian only?),
	there are conflicts between chimera's Tcl/Tk libraries and the system ones.
	A workaround is to add a couple of symbolic links in the lib directory
	of the chimera installation:
	<blockquote><pre><code>
% cd ..../chimera/lib
% ln -s libtk8.3.so libtk8.3.so.1
% ln -s libtcl8.3.so libtcl8.3.so.1
	</code></pre></blockquote>
	<li>On some Windows machines, attempting to launch Chimera
	produces an error dialog saying that some unspecified file's name
	has bad syntax.  If you have this problem send 
	<a href="mailto:chimera-bugs@cgl.ucsf.edu">us</a> mail and we will send you
	a fixed version of chimera.exe.
	<li>Resizing the model panel's sequence window starts a bizarre near-infinite
	resizing loop.  Workaround:  don't resize it!
	<li>On certain Windows installations, the &quot;Distances&quot; and
	&quot;Adjust Torsions&quot; panes of the Structure Measurements dialog
	cannot be resized.
	The workaround is to switch to the &quot;Angles/Torsions&quot; pane (which
	can be resized), resize that to the size you want the non-resizable pane to be,
	and then switch back to the non-resizable pane.
      </ul>
