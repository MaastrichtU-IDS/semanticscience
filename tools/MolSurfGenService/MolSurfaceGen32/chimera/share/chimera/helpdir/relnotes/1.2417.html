    <h2>UCSF Chimera Version 1.0 Build 2417 Release Notes (30 May 2007)</h2>

    <h3>
      Changes since the <a href="1.2304.html">previous production release (1.0 build 2304)</a>:
    </h3>

<blockquote>
  <h4>General:</h4>
  <ul>
  <li>switched from using the Numeric Python extension to
  <a href="http://numpy.scipy.org/">NumPy</a> &mdash; <b>this may break
    third-party extensions</b>
  <li>POV-Ray now included for direct production of shadowed images
  (see <b>File... Save Image</b>): 
    <ul>
    <li>new <b>POV-Ray Options</b> section of <b>Preferences</b>
    <li>ribbon style <b>supersmooth</b> added for use with raytracing
    <li>standard and 2D labels included
    <li>as with all raytracers,
    images with transparency take significantly longer to render
    </ul>
  <li><b>Save Image</b> dialog changed to use pixels as the default units
  and to include the supersampling and print resolution settings
  (formerly in the <b>Image Setup</b> preferences)
  <li><b>Presets</b> menu added for convenient access to display settings 
  for interactive and publication usage scenarios 
  <li>new built-in ribbon scaling, <b>licorice</b> 
  (does not vary with secondary structure); 
   minor changes in <b>Chimera default</b> scaling
  <li>VRML import now supports PROTOs (ie., should work for
  <a href="http://www.cmbi.ru.nl/molden/molden.html">molden</a>,
  and older Honig lab GRASS, output)
  <li>new input format MDL MOL/SDF
  <li>new <b>Fetch by ID</b> types: 
  EDS (fo-fc) electron density difference map, PQS predicted biological unit
  <li>opening electrostatic potential data (APBS, Delphi, Grasp, UHBD) now
  starts <b>Electrostatic Surface Coloring</b> instead of <b>Volume Viewer</b>
  <li>compressed files (*.Z) can be recognized and opened for many input types
  if gzip is on the user's execution path
  <li>multiple models saved to a single PDB file are delimited by MODEL/ENDMDL
  records instead of END records
  <li><b>Select... Chain</b> menu now includes rollovers for chain IDs that
  appear in more than one model, allowing selection of a chain within
  a specific model or (as before) all models
  <li><b>Select... Structure</b> menu now includes <b>nucleic acid</b>
  and <b>protein</b>
  <li><b>Actions... Atoms/Bonds</b> now has three options for displaying 
  backbone only: chain trace, full, and minimal
  <li><b>Actions... Focus</b>
  adjusts the view as before, but then sets the
  center of rotation to track the center of view
  (rather than setting a fixed center based on the specified atoms)
  <li>changes in preferences:
    <ul>
    <li>a preferences file can be specified at startup with <b>--preferences</b>
    <li>the preferences file location is reported but can no longer be changed
    from within the <b>Preferences</b> dialog
    <li>the preferences file can be designated read-only
    <li>settings in each tab of the <b>Viewing</b> tool
    can be explicitly saved to and restored from the preferences file
    <li><b>Collaboratory</b> and <b>Image Setup</b> sections removed
    </ul>
  <li>VRex row stereo mode removed
  <li>camera mode and stereo parameters are saved in sessions
  <li>improved session merging (opening a session in the presence of
   pre-existing models)
  <li>mouse mode for pop-up Chimera menu implemented
  (see the <b>Mouse</b> preferences)
  <li>on Windows, rolling the mouse scroll wheel is another way to scale
  <li>added 64-bit Linux AMD64/EMT64 production release
  <li>added Mac OS X Aqua snapshot release (for users who need stereo,
  full-window antialiasing, and/or background transparency)
  <li>added orthographic support to export formats
  <li>export labels to X3D and POV-Ray files

  (r for ribbon, <i>etc.</i>) to be comma-separated 
  (this was already the case for <b>color</b>)
  <li><b>copy</b> &mdash; raytracing keywords added
  <li><b>focus</b> &mdash; adjusts the view as before,
  but then sets the center of rotation to track the center of view

  supersampled or raytraced, movie can be encoded as a "round trip"
  <li><b>open</b> &mdash; <b>noprefs</b> keyword added to bypass the

  inconsistent behavior of scripts potentially caused by the different
  preferences settings of different users)

  <li>corrected label position/scale in saved images smaller than the 
  current display (standard and 2D labels)

  generated PDB files
  <li>export transparency correctly to POV-Ray files
