<h2>
Known bugs:
</h2>

<p>
<b>Wire bonds disappear on large PDB models on Mac.</b>
Bonds in wire display mode appear correctly when a large model (eg 1aon)
is first opened, but then many of them disappear when the model is moved.
This is an OpenGL driver bug in Mac OS 10.2.6 that has been reported to
Apple.
</p>

<p>
<b>MSMS surface crashes on Mac.</b>
MSMS molecular surfaces of large PDB models (eg 1lta, 6400 atoms) cause
Chimera to crash on Mac OS.  The problem is caused by the default Mac
stack size limit of 512 Kb.  This can be fixed by adding the line
"ulimit -s 8192" to the Chimera.app/Contents/MacOS/chimera start-up
script for the X11 Mac Chimera.  For the Aqua Chimera you can set
a higher limit in a shell, and run Chimera from the shell instead
of clicking on the icon.  The next Mac Chimera release increases the
stack size on startup.
</p>

<p>
<b>DelphiViewer data alignment error.</b>
DelphiViewer displays potential data shifted by one voxel from the
correct alignment.  This makes the coloring of MSMS or GRASP molecular
surfaces using the potential incorrect.  VolumeViewer also displays the
potential data (*.phi files) shifted by one voxel.  The DelphiViewer
trilinear interpolation for surface coloring is also done incorrectly
making colors correspond to positions as much as one voxel away.
</p>

<p>
<b>Copy command makes strange image.</b>
Use of the copy command when widgets are in front of the graphics window results in strange images.
</p>

<p>
<b>Saving <small>JPEG</small>-format images unreliable.</b>
Saving an image to <small>JPEG</small> format often fails.
If you are saving to <small>JPEG</small> due to the large size
of (uncompressed) <small>TIFF</small>-format images,
try using <small>PNG</small> format instead [it has built-in compression].
</p>

<p>
<b>Collaboratory hangs on multiprocessor IRIX.</b>
</p>

<p>
<b>Mac OS 10.2.4 / Radeon 9000 system crash.</b>
On Mac OS 10.2.4 with Radeon 9000 graphics Chimera sometimes
causes a system crash when using the side view.  This is a graphics driver
bug that has been fixed in Mac OS 10.2.5.
The crash happens after opening PDB 1gcn with the side view up and
switching to sphere representation.
</p>

<p>
<b>Mac OS 10.2.4 / GeForce 4 Ti system crash.</b>
On Mac OS 10.2.4 with GeForce 4 Ti graphics Chimera sometimes
causes a system crash when showing large models.  This is a graphics driver
bug that has been fixed in Mac OS 10.2.5.
The crash happens after starting the Benchmark extension and making a standard
surface model of size 200.
</p>

<p>
<b>Partially displayed surfaces Linux / Nvidia.</b>
On Linux with the nVidia 3123 driver MSMS surfaces and
Volume Viewer isosurfaces are sometimes only partly displayed
on GeForce 4 Ti and Quadro 4 graphics cards.  This is a bug in
the nVidia 3123 driver.  The older 2880 driver and the newer
4191 driver do not have this problem.  For volume isosurfaces,
using a non-zero transparency works around the problem.
</p>

<p>
<b>Missing selection outline with Mesa.</b>
With Mesa 3.4.2 (softare OpenGL sometimes used on Linux and Mac)
Chimera selections (atoms, bonds ...) do not show a green outline.
The outline is black.  Also dragging a selection box with the
mouse produces a black box instead of a green box.  This is a Mesa
bug.  Setting Fill mode for selection highlighting in Preferences
works around this problem.
</p>

<p>
<b>Orphaned molecular surfaces.</b>
A surface whose structure has been closed causes two problems:
session saving fails; the model panel's attributes inspector
for the surface will fail.
</p>

<p>
<b>Command separator ";" bug</b>
Multiple command-line commands separated by ';' may not work
correctly (<i>e.g.</i> <code>open 1gcn; surface</code> 
will not properly show a surface).
</p>

<p>
<b>Bad atom types on Mac.</b>
The mac distribution mistakenly includes an obsolete version of 
the code that computes atom types.  In particular, it computes the
atom type of carboxylate and nitro-group oxygens to be &quot;O-&quot;
(an obsolete type)
when they should be &quot;O2-&quot;.  This causes the FindHBond tool to
fail to find hydrogen bonds involving carboxylates and nitro groups.
