    <h2>UCSF Chimera Version 1.0 Build 2304 Release Notes (16 October 2006)</h2>

    <h3>
      Changes since the <a href="1.2199.html">previous production release (1.0 build 2199)</a>:
    </h3>

    <blockquote>

      <h4>General:</h4>
      <ul>

	<li>smaller session files, faster session save/restore 

	<li>CIF/mmCIF files can be read (local or fetched by ID from the PDB)

	<li>electron density maps can be fetched by PDB ID
	from the Electron Density Server

	<li>Virus Particle Explorer (VIPER) files can be fetched by ID

	<li>VIPER input automatically starts Multiscale Models,
	constructs viral capsid 

	<li>Save File dialog adjusted to clarify
	how to save untransformed coordinates

	<li>smaller default ribbon height/width (ribbon scaling)

	<li>can color <code>by heteroatom</code>
	(same as <code>by element</code> except carbons not affected)

	<li>in the command line,
	<code>:30-40</code> (for example) now specifies those residues in
	any/all chains,
	whereas <code>:20-30.</code> specifies those residues in blank-ID chains

	<li>locations of files opened by command files and python scripts now
	specified relative to the location of the command file/script,
	or with absolute pathnames

	<li>rules defining <i>solvent</i> and <i>ions</i> adjusted slightly,
	so that small coordination complexes, such as cobalt hexammine,
	are classified as <i>ions</i>

	<li>VRML export works for all scene data, not just surfaces

	<li>can switch to sequential stereo mid-session without having used
	--stereo at startup (except on certain Windows systems)

	<li>stereo images can be saved

	<li>red-cyan (anaglyph) stereo option added

	<li>faster methodology used for displaying labels 

	<li>improved silhouette edge rendering

	<li>on the Mac, starting Chimera starts X11 automatically,
	and after Chimera has been started,
	clicking the Chimera icon in the dock will bring the 
	Chimera window to the front

      </ul>

      <h4>New Tools:</h4>
      <ul>

	<li><b>Add Charge</b> (Structure Editing) &mdash;

	  calculate charges for nonstandard residues
