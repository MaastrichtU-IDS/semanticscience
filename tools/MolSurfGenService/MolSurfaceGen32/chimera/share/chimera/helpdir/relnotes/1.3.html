  <h2>UCSF Chimera Version 1.3 Release Notes (8 Dec 2008)</h2>

  <h3>
   Changes since the <a href="1.2540.html">previous production release (1.0 build 2540)</a>:
  </h3>

  <blockquote>
   <h4>New version numbering system</h4>
   Chimera version numbers now have an extra level.
   The previous production release is now officially 1.0 build 2540.
   <i>a.k.a.</i> release number 1.0.2540, instead of 1.2540.
   If a bug fix version of 1.3 comes out, it will be 1.3.1
   with the release numbers being 1.3.2 and 1.3.1.X.

   <h4>General:</h4>
   <ul>
    <li><b>Actions... Focus</b> with nothing selected
    restores default rotation behavior, "center of models"
    <li>added <b>Debug Graphics Driver</b> panel for selectively disabling
    OpenGL features to find workarounds for graphics driver bugs (opened with 
    startup option --debug-opengl or specified in the General preferences)
    <li>recent commands are remembered between sessions; 
    how many to remember is set in the
    <b>Command Line</b> preferences (formerly <b>Midas</b> preferences)
    <li>commands can be deleted from the <b>Command History</b>; 
    saving all commands in the history is easier than before
    <li>CASTp pocket measurements can be read from local files 
    that were e-mailed to the user by the CASTp server
    <li>copy/combine function added to <b>Model Panel</b> 
    (creates another copy of a molecule model or combines multiple
    molecule models into one)
    <li>anisotropic B-factors saved in sessions
    <li> startup option --reverse-stereo and similar setting in <b>Camera</b>
     to reverse eye views when in sequential stereo; compensates for the
     reversal introduced by certain devices
    <li>new Mac Aqua-specific preferences:  
    menus in windows (<b>General</b> category), 
    window focus follows mouse (<b>Mouse</b> category)
   </ul>

   <h4>New Tools:</h4>

      <li>can be started from <b>Surface Color</b> or 
      <b>Render by Attribute</b>, set to the current coloring scheme
      </ul>

    <li><b>Write DMS</b> (Structure Editing) &mdash; 
    save molecular surface as DMS file 
    (which can be used as input to the sphgen program distributed with DOCK)
 
    <li><b>Write Prmtop</b> (Amber) &mdash; 
    write Amber parameter/topology file using AmberTools
    (implementation thanks to Wei Zhang)

   </ul>

   <h4>Tool Changes:</h4>
   <ul>

    <li><b>Add Charge</b> 
    &mdash; includes several choices of Amber force field version 
    (formerly only ff99) to use for standard residues

    <li><b>Axes</b> (Structure Analysis) &mdash;
    <ul>
     <li>helical correction after principal component calculation now optional 
     <li>custom axis calculation can be mass-weighted 
     <li>axes can be deleted or individually hidden/shown
     <li>option to remove previous axes when creating new ones
     <li>information can be saved to a file
    </ul>

    <li><b>Build Structure</b> (Structure Editing) &mdash; 
    <b>Modify Atom</b> rearranged and simplified,
    can act on more than one atom at a time

    <li><b>Distances</b> (Structure Analysis) &mdash; table is sortable

    <li><b>Fourier Transform</b> &mdash; removed from <b>Tools</b> menu, 
    now available as an option of the command <b>vop</b>

    <li><b>MatchMaker</b> (Structure Comparison) &mdash; 
    RMSD header shown, other headers hidden in output sequence alignments 

    <li><b>Multalign Viewer</b> (Structure Comparison) &mdash;
    added Ctrl-key editing undo/redo, dialog listing Ctrl-key functions

    <li><b>Per-Model Clipping</b> (Depiction) &mdash; 
     added surface capping button

    <li><b>Render by Attribute</b> (Depiction, Structure Analysis) &mdash; 
    <b>Colors</b> section includes button to create color key

    <li><b>Sequence</b> (Structure Analysis) &mdash; merged into
    <b>Multalign Viewer</b>, no longer implemented separately

    <li><b>Side View</b> (Viewing Controls) &mdash; 
     added surface capping button

    <li><b>Surface Color</b> (Volume Data), aka
    <b>Electrostatic Surface Coloring</b> (Surface/Binding Analysis) &mdash; 
      <ul>
      <li><b>Options</b> section includes button to create color key
      <li>default electrostatic coloring scheme no longer includes transparency
      </ul>

    <li><b>Volume Series</b> (Volume Data) &mdash; 
    multiple series can be played simultaneously

    <li><b>Volume Viewer</b> (Volume Data) &mdash; 
      <ul>
      <li><b>Planes</b> interface changed, faster plane display
      <li>surface/mesh styles can be used to show single planes as
      contour lines and spots
      <li><b>Coordinates</b> section shows grid indices of XYZ origin 
       rather than XYZ coordinates of grid origin
      <li>solid rendering faster and more efficient; options added for
       tailoring memory use to the current data and display mode
      </ul>

   </ul>

   <h4>New Commands:</h4>
   <ul>
    <li><b>combine</b> &mdash; combine molecule models into a single model
    or create another copy of a molecule model
   </ul>

   <h4>Command Changes:</h4>
   <ul>
    <li><b>addcharge</b>
    &mdash; includes several choices of Amber force field version 
    (formerly only ff99) to use for standard residues
    <li><b>copy</b> &mdash; image pixel width and/or height can be specified
    <li><b>findclash</b> &mdash; allows continuous clash/contact monitoring
    <li><b>focus</b> &mdash; focusing on everything (<b>focus</b> with no
    arguments or new <b>~focus</b> command) restores default rotation behavior,
    "center of models"
    <li><b>molmap</b> &mdash; showDialog option allows suppressing
   the <b>Volume Viewer</b> dialog
    <li><b>volume</b> &mdash; solid rendering options changed in parallel with
   <b>Volume Viewer</b> dialog
    <li><b>vop</b> &mdash; added Fourier transform option
   </ul>

   <h4>Major Bugs Fixed:</h4>
   <ul>
    <li>07/30/2008 restored better-looking default subdivision quality 
   (affects smoothness of curved objects) 
    <li>08/08/2008 <b>Axes</b> measurements based on transformed coordinates
   rather than untransformed (affects intermodel measurements when the models
   have been separately transformed)
   </ul>

   <h4>Known Bugs:</h4>
   <ul>
     <li>Mac OS 10.5 / X11 problems (fixed in XQuartz 2.3.2rc3):
       <ul>
       <li> sometimes display does not update
       (can be forced by slightly moving the view contents with the mouse)
       <li> sometimes saved images have a corrupt or "mis-tiled" appearance.
        Workarounds to try include:
         <ul>
         <li>showing the <b>Command Line</b> if it is not shown 
        (or if it is shown, hiding it) and then re-saving the image
         <li>saving a session, restoring the session in the Mac Aqua
         version of Chimera, and then re-saving the image
         </ul>
       </ul>
    <li>surfaces fail for some structures
    <li>incomplete/patchwork surfaces with some Linux versions of libGL
    (Mesa bug 12141 fixed in Mesa 7.0.2).  Commonly observed when
    running chimera remotely on a Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server 5
    and other earlier versions of Linux.
    <li>on Linux, the default font is wrong when using the KDE window manager
    <li>mmCIF NMR ensembles have missing disulfide bonds in all but one structure
    <li>mmCIF structures with hydrogens may be missing N-terminal bonds between hydrogen and nitrogen
   </ul>
