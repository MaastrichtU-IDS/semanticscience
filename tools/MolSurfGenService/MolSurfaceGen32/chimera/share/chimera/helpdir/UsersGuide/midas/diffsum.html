<h3>Atom Specification in Chimera versus Midas</h3>
<p>
While <a href="frameatom_spec.html" target="_top">atom specification 
in Chimera</a>
is very similar to that in Midas/MidasPlus, there are some significant
differences, which are summarized below. 
</p><p>
The differences in atom specification mainly reflect additions 
that do not affect the process of adapting a Midas script
for use in Chimera.  However, note that in Chimera, chain IDs are specified
differently and <b>mainchain</b> is not accepted as a specifier.
A few Midas/MidasPlus commands are
<a href="../unsupported.html">unsupported by Chimera</a>.
</p>
In Chimera:
<ul>
<li> The <a href="atom_spec.html#basic">three major levels</a>
 in the hierarchy (# for model, : for residue,
 and @ for atom) can each have <a href="atom_spec.html#subcats">
 sub-specifications</a> indicated after "."
 (submodel, chain ID, and alternate location indicator, respectively).  This
 is a major improvement, because:
   <ul>
   <li>When multiple MODEL records appear in a single PDB file,
   each MODEL can now be specified independently as a submodel
   (for example, <b>#0.2</b> is the second submodel in model 0).  In Midas,
   the only way to see one structure at a time is to edit the input file.
   <li>One can specify an entire chain without knowing the starting and
   ending residue numbers (for example, <b>:.a</b> specificies all of chain A).
   <li>Atoms in alternate locations can be controlled independently.
   </ul>

<li> Atoms/bonds that are <a href="../selection.html">selected</a> in
 the graphics window can be designated with the word
 <b>selected</b>, <b>sel</b>, or <b>picked</b>.

<li>The name of a <a href="../selection.html#pickselect">picked</a>
  atom is not echoed in the command line (as in the most recent version of
  Midas), but entering a plus sign (<b>+</b>) indicates that the plus sign
  should be replaced by the specification string of the next
  <a href="../selection.html#pickselect">picked</a> atom (similar to an
  older version of Midas).
  
<li> Selections previously named and saved with
 <a href="../menu.html#namesel"><b>Select... Name Selection</b></a>
 or the command <a href="namesel"><b>namesel</b></a>
 can be specified using <b>sel=<i>selection_name</i></b> or just
 <b><i>selection_name</i></b>

<li> One can use names of entries in the following parts of the
Chimera <a href="../menu.html#menuselect"><b>Select</b> menu</a>:
   <ul>
   <li><b>Chemistry... element</b> and submenus
   <li><b>Chemistry... functional group</b> and submenus
   <li><b>Chemistry... <a href="../idatm.html">IDATM type</a></b>
   <li><b>Residue... <a href="../../ContributedSoftware/resprop/resprop.html#aac
at">amino acid category</a></b>
   <li><b>Structure</b>
(which includes the <a href="surface.html#surfcats">automatic categories for
surface calculation</a>:  <b>main</b>, <b>ligand</b>, <b>solvent</b>,
and <b>ions</b>) and submenus
   </ul>
The same pattern of capitalization and spaces, if any, as shown in the
<a href="../menu.html#menuselect"><b>Select</b> menu</a> should be used.
Where there is ambiguity, the parent menu should be included in the
specification, for example, "IDATM type.H" or "element.H" instead of "H" alone.
<br>
One can also use the names of custom amino acid categories defined with
<a href="../../ContributedSoftware/resprop/resprop.html"><b>ResProp</b></a>
and custom categories for surface calculation defined with the
command <a href="msms.html"><b>msms cat</b> (<b>surfcat</b>)</a>.
<li> The word <b>mainchain</b> is not accepted as an atom specification.
<li> There are several differences in
  <a href="atom_spec.html#descriptors">property (attribute) descriptor
  syntax</a>:
  <ul>
  <li> In Chimera, property descriptors are termed 
  <a href="atom_spec.html#descriptors">attributes</a> and are
  defined at the <a href="atom_spec.html#atprops">atom</a>,
  <a href="atom_spec.html#resprops">residue</a>,
  and <a href="atom_spec.html#modprops">model</a> levels.  Thus,
  the attribute indicator slash ("/") must be preceded by the proper symbol 
  (#, :, or @) depending on what level is being described.  The symbol
  does not have to precede the slash <i>immediately</i> (for example,
  <b>@ca/color=red</b> indicates red atoms named CA).  In Midas, all the
  properties are atomic, so the symbol before the slash is not required
  unless an atom name is also being used.  There are more 
  <a href="atom_spec.html#descriptors">attributes</a> in Chimera than in Midas.
  <li>When multiple attributes
  at the same level are combined in one statement, they must
  be separated with <b>and</b> and/or <b>or</b> to indicate intersection
  or union, respectively.  In Midas, commas indicate intersection
  (and for colors only, union) and multiple occurrences of slash indicate
  union.
  <li><b>Not</b> is indicated for yes/no properties with
  <b>!</b><i>descriptor_name</i>, and for multivalued properties with
  <i>descriptor_name</i><b>!=</b><i>value</i>.  In Midas, <b>!</b> always
  precedes the <i>descriptor_name</i>.
  <li>The operators <b>~</b> and <b>!~</b> can be used instead of
  <b>=</b> and <b>!=</b>, respectively, to
  indicate that the subsequent string should be treated as a
<a href="http://www.python.org/doc/current/lib/re-syntax.html" target="_blank">
  regular expression</a>.
  <li>The <i>descriptor_name</i> is case-sensitive; the
   descriptor <i>value</i>, if any, is case-sensitive if specified
   with <b>==</b>, but not if specified with <b>=</b>.
  </ul>
</ul>
