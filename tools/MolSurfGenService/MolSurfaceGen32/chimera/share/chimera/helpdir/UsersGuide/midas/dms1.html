<h4>NAME</h4>
  <h3>dms - calculate a molecular surface</h3>

<h4>SYNOPSIS</h4>
<h3><b>dms</b> <i>pdbfile</i> [ -a ] [ -d <i>density</i>] [ -g <i>logfile</i> ]
 [ -i <i>sitefile</i> ] [-n] [-w <i>radius</i> ] [-v] -o <i>outfile</i>
</h3>

<h4>DESCRIPTION</h4>
<p>
  <b>Dms</b> calculates the molecular surface of a molecule.
  The molecular surface
  resembles the van der Waals surface of a molecule, except that crevices
  between atoms are smoothed over and interstices too small to accommodate
  the probe are eliminated.  The surface includes cavities in the interior of
  the molecule, even if they are not accessible to a solvent molecule coming
  from the outside.
</p><p>
  The molecular surface calculated is that defined by Richards (see
  the <a href="#ref">reference</a> below).
  In particular, the calculated molecular surface is that traced out by
  the surface of the probe sphere rather that the
  probe sphere's center.  According to Richards' definition, the molecular
  surface consists of two parts: contact surface and reentrant surface. The
  contact surface is made up of "those parts of the molecular van der Waals
  surface that can actually be in contact with the surface of the probe."
  The reentrant surface is defined by "the interior-facing part of the probe
  when it is simultaneously in contact with more than one atom."  <b>Dms</b>
  reports the amounts of contact and reentrant surface area, and the combined
  total surface area on the standard error output (see <a href="#gflag">
  <b>-g</b></a>).
</p><p>
  <i>Pdbfile</i> is an input file of coordinates.
  The input file must be in the Protein Data Bank format.
  The first part of each atom
  name is used to determine the element type.  By default, implicit hydrogens
  are included for carbon, nitrogen and oxygen atoms; thus, aromatic carbons
  and nitrogens will have van der Waals radii that are somewhat too big.
  Note that only amino acid and nucleic acid residues will be included unless
  <a href="#aflag"><b>-a</b></a> is also specified.
</p>

<h4>COMMAND-LINE ARGUMENTS</h4>

<blockquote>
<a name="aflag">
  <tt><b>-a</b></tt>
</a>
<br>Include all atoms, not just those in amino acid and nucleic acid residues.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <tt><b>-d</b> <i>density</i></tt>
<br>   <i>Density</i> is a factor affecting the density of points
       on the surface; the default of <b>1.0</b>
       produces about 5 points per square angstrom.  Only values between
       <b>0.1</b> and <b>10.0</b> are permitted.
       A density of <b>0.5</b> is recommended for large molecules.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<a name="gflag">
  <tt><b>-g</b> <i>logfile</i></tt>
</a>
<br>   Write all the informative messages to <i>logfile</i> instead of the
       standard error output.  Genuine errors still go to the standard error
       output.  New log information is appended to <i>logfile</i> rather than
       overwriting it, and thus messages from several runs may be accumulated.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<a name="iflag">
  <tt><b>-i</b> <i>sitefile</i></tt>
</a>
<br>   Calculate the molecular surface only for those residues and atoms
       specified in <i>sitefile</i>,
       keeping the rest of the molecule for collision checks.
       <i>Sitefile</i> consists of lines such as the following:
<blockquote><tt>
<table>
<tr>
<td>ASP</td> <td align="right">205</td> <td>CA</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>TYR</td> <td align="right">13</td> <td>*</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>GLY</td> <td align="right">116</td> <td>FRM</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>HIS</td> <td align="right">178</td> <td>TO</td>
</tr>
</table>
</tt></blockquote>
       The asterisk, <b>*</b>, means all atoms of the residue, and the 
       "FRM" and "TO" lines mean all residues from 116 to 178 inclusive.
       The sequence number may
       contain letters, and if the PDB input file contains chain identifiers,
       then those should be appended on the right of the sequence number.
       Residue insertion codes (if any) should be placed between the sequence
       number and any chain identifier.	 Residues contained in HETATM records
       should have an asterisk appended to the end of the residue identifier.
       The surface generated using <a href="#iflag"><b>-i</b></a>
       is not always the same as the
       surface generated by running the entire molecule and afterwards
       selecting the desired atoms.  The first surface will not include
       reentrant surface lying between an atom in <i>sitefile</i> and atoms not
       in the file.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<a name="nflag">
  <tt><b>-n</b></tt>
</a>
<br>   Include the unit normals to the surface with each surface point record.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <tt><b>-w</b> <i>radius</i></tt>
<br>   Change the "water" probe <i>radius</i> from the default of <b>1.4</b>
       angstroms.  <i>Radius</i> must be between <b>1.0</b> and <b>201.0</b>.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <tt><b>-v</b></tt>
<br>   Produce more verbose output.  <b>Dms</b>
       will announce each computation phase
       as it is entered as well as a count of the atom types in the molecule
       and the number of computation requests handled by each host that
       participated in the calculation.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <tt><b>-o</b> <i>outfile</i></tt>
<br>   The output surface is written to <i>outfile</i>.
       This flag is not optional.
</blockquote>

<p>
<a name="dmsformat">DMS file format</a>:<br>
  The output consists of a series of atom and surface point records, with the
  same format for the first six fields.	 Each atom is followed by the surface
  points (if any) which belong to it.  These first six fields are in the
  following format: residue name, sequence number, atom name, x coordinate,
  y coordinate, z coordinate.  For an atom record, the seventh field is "A."
  For a surface point record, the seventh field begins with an "S,"
  followed by a "C," "R," or "S" according to whether the point is part of
  contact, reentrant, or saddle surface (saddle is a type of reentrant
   surface where the probe is in contact with exactly two atoms).  This
  is followed by a digit used for depicting different density levels.  The
  eighth field is the molecular surface area associated with the point in
  square angstroms.  If <a href="#nflag"><b>-n</b></a> is specified, the
  next three fields are
  the unit normal vector pointing outward from the surface.
  Messages and errors are written to the standard error output
  unless a separate log file has been
  specified with <a href="#gflag"><b>-g</b></a>.
</p><p>
  <b>Dms</b> reads the elements and radii from a file named <b>radii</b>.
  The default file is
  /usr/local/chimera/share/dms/<a href="radii">radii</a>. 
  If there is a file in the current
  directory called <b>radii</b>, then <b>dms</b> will use that file instead.
  To add uncommon elements or use different radii, one should copy the
  <a href="radii">default file</a> and modify it.
  The file format is documented in the file itself.
