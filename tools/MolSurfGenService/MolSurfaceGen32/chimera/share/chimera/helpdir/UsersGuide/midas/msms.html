<h3><a href="usageconventions.html">Usage</a>:
 <br>( <b>surfrepr</b> | <b>msms repr</b> ) <i>style</i>
<i>model_number(s)</i></h3>
<h3><a href="usageconventions.html">Usage</a>:
 <br>( <b>surfcat</b> | <b>msms cat</b> ) <i>category_name</i>
<a href="frameatom_spec.html" target="_top"><i>atom-spec</i></a></h3>
<p>
<b>Surfrepr</b> (<b>msms repr</b>) changes the 
<a href="../representation.html#surfaces">surface representation</a>
of the specified models to the specified <i>style</i>.
The <i>model_number(s)</i> should be preceded by #, as in a normal
<a href="atom_spec.html#basic">atom specification</a>.
If no model numbers are given, all surface models will be affected.
Possible values for <i>style</i> are:
    <ul>
    <li><b>filled</b> or <b>solid</b> (solid surface)
    <li><b>mesh</b> (the surface polygon edges only are shown)
    <li><b>dot</b> (the surface polygon vertices only are shown)
    </ul>
</p><p>
<b>Surfcat</b> (<b>msms cat</b>) is used to create groupings
of atoms for subsequent surface calculations.
The atoms in
<a href="frameatom_spec.html" target="_top"><i>atom-spec</i></a>
are assigned to a category named <i>category_name</i>.
A category's surface can then be displayed with the command
<A href="surface.html"><b>surface</b></A>.
</p><p>
In many cases, the 
<a href="surface.html#surfcats">automatic categories</a> suffice and
<b>surfcat</b> is not required.  Categories are mutually exclusive,
that is, an atom can only be in one category at a time. 
When atoms are placed in a new category, they are subtracted from the 
category they occupied previously.
</p><p>
<a name="example">
In the following example, the sidechains and backbone of a peptide
are placed in separate categories, and a surface is shown for the 
sidechain portion.
<blockquote><tt><b>
open 1gcn
<br>surfcat schain #0
<br>surfcat bbone @n,ca,c,o
<br>surface schain
</b></tt></blockquote>
</p><p>
In the next example, the structure has two DNA chains (E and F)
and three protein chains (A-C).
<a href="surface.html#surfcats">Automatic categorization</a> would put
all of these chains in category <b>main</b> and enclose them in a single
surface:  
<blockquote><tt><b>
open 1tup; rainbow chain
<br>surface
</b></tt></blockquote>
To separately enclose the DNA and the protein: 
<blockquote><tt><b>
surfcat dna nucleic acid
<br>surf dna 
</b></tt></blockquote>
To further enclose each protein chain separately:
<blockquote><tt><b>
surfcat one :.a
<br>surfcat two :.b
<br>surfcat three :.c
<br>surf one | two | three
</b></tt></blockquote>
