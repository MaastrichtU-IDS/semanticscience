<h3><a href="usageconventions.html">Usage</a>:
 <BR><b>cd</b><i> path_name</i></h3>
<p>
<b>Cd</b> changes the current working directory to <i>path_name</i>.
If you are not familiar with the concept of directories and path names,
see "UNIX for Beginners" (Kernighan) and the description of the <b>cd</b>
command in section 1 of the "UNIX User's Manual."
Note that subsequent commands with filename arguments 
(for example, <b><A href="open.html">open</A></b> and
<b><A href="write.html">write</A></b>)
are executed in the new working directory.</p>
<p>
Example:
<blockquote><tt>
<b>cd ../crodna</b>
</tt></blockquote>
