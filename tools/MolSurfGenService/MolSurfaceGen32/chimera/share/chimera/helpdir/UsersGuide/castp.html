<h2>CASTp Data</h2>

<p>
A structure and its precalculated pocket measurements can be retrieved by
<a href="http://www.rcsb.org/robohelp_f/search_database/pdb_identifier.htm"
target="_blank">PDB ID</a> from the
<a href="http://sts-fw.bioengr.uic.edu/castp/index.php"
target="_blank">Computed Atlas of Surface Topography of proteins (CASTp)
database</a> using <a href="fetch.html"><b>Fetch by ID</b></a> or the
command <a href="midas/open.html"><b>open</b></a> 
(with prefix <b>castp:</b>).
The database does not contain all PDB entries, and structures
may be older versions of the current PDB entries.  
</p><p>
Results for a structure not in the CASTp database can be shown in Chimera
by requesting a calculation at the
<a href="http://sts-fw.bioengr.uic.edu/castp/calculation.php" target="_blank">
CASTp server</a> and opting for results to be returned by e-mail.  
After the results have been received and unzipped, opening the
file named <b>*.poc</b> in Chimera automatically also reads files with the
same name/location except the suffixes <b>.pdb</b>, <b>.pocInfo</b>, 
<b>.mouth</b>, and <b>.mouthInfo</b>.
</p><p>
CASTp information includes:
<ul>
<li>which atoms form pockets and pocket mouths
<li>pocket volume and surface area
<li>mouth opening area and circumference
</ul>
based on Delaunay triangulation, alpha shape, and discrete flow calculations

Retrieving/opening CASTp results in Chimera shows the structure 
in the main graphics window and associated data in a dialog, 
or <b>Pocket List</b>. 
</p>

<a name="pocketlist">
<h3>CASTp Pocket List</h3></a>

<table border="1" align="right" style="margin:8px 8px 8px 8px"> 
<tr><td><img src="castp.png" alt="1ovh pocket list"></td></tr>
</table>
<p>
Each row in the dialog describes a <b><i>pocket</i></b>, which could
be an internal cavity completely enclosed by atoms or a indentation with
one or more openings to the external surface.  Measurements are with
respect to the <b><i>molecular surface</i></b> (solvent-excluded surface;
probe contact + reentrant) or the <b><i>solvent-accessible surface</i></b> 
(that traced by the probe center).  
</p><p>
Each type of measurement can be shown or hidden using the <b>Columns</b> menu:
<ul>
<li><b>ID</b> - pocket identifier
<li><b>MS volume</b> - pocket volume based on the molecular surface
<li><b>SA volume</b> - pocket volume based on the solvent-accessible surface
<li><b>pocket MS area</b> - pocket molecular surface area
<li><b>pocket SA area</b> - pocket solvent-accessible surface area
<li><b># openings</b> - number of <b><i>mouths</i></b>, or
openings to the external molecular surface
<li><b>mouth MS area</b> - total area of mouth opening(s) 
based on the molecular surface
<li><b>mouth SA area</b> - total area of mouth opening(s) 
based on the solvent-accessible surface
<li><b>MS circumference sum</b> - total circumference of mouth opening(s)
based on the molecular surface
<li><b>SA circumference sum</b> - total circumference of mouth opening(s)
based on the solvent-accessible surface
<li><b>sum arc length</b> - total length of arcs formed 
where two pocket atoms meet
<li><b># corner points</b> - number of corner points formed 
where three pocket atoms meet
<li><b># triangles</b> - total number of Delaunay triangles of mouth opening(s)
</ul>
Column display settings are saved in the
<a href="preferences.html#preffile"><b>preferences</b> file</a>
and used for subsequently retrieved CASTp data.
If the pocket list is hidden or obscured by other windows,
it can be raised using its <a href="instances.html">instance</a> 
in the <b>Tools</b> menu.
</p><p>
The pocket list can be sorted by the values in any displayed column by
clicking the column header.  Clicking the header once sorts the entries
in order of increasing value and places an up arrowhead (triangle)
in the header.  Clicking again sorts the entries in decreasing
order and places a down arrowhead (inverted triangle) in the header.
</p><p>
<a name="chosen">
A pocket can be <b><i>chosen</i></b> by clicking on its line,</a>
and multiple pockets can be chosen at once.  
Chosen lines are highlighted in the dialog.
<b>Ctrl</b>-click toggles the status of a line, while clicking on the first 
(or last) line of a contiguous block and then <b>Shift</b>-clicking 
on the last (or first) chooses all of the lines in the block.
</p><p>
Options for the <b>Treatment of Chosen Pocket Atoms</b>:
<ul>
<li><b>Select</b> - <a href="selection.html">select</a> the atoms for further 
<a href="menu.html#menuactions">actions</a> 
<li><b>Color</b> [ <a href="coloring.html#colorwell">color well</a> ]
<b>(and color all other atoms</b>
[ <a href="coloring.html#colorwell">color well</a> ]<b>)</b>
(factory defaults are <b>orange</b> and <b>No color</b>, respectively; 
using <b>No color</b>
reveals <a href="hierarchy.html">model-level colors</a>)
<li><b>Surface</b> - show
<a href="representation.html#surfaces">molecular surface</a>
contributed by the atoms; 
the first time surface is shown for a given structure,
there may be a lag of several seconds as the surface is calculated
<li><b>Zoom in on</b> - <a href="midas/focus.html">focus</a> on the atoms
and adjust view orientation
<li><b>Exclude mouth atoms</b> 
- whether to omit pocket mouth atoms, if any, from the specified treatments
</ul>
Option settings are saved in the
<a href="preferences.html#preffile"><b>preferences</b> file</a>
and used for subsequently retrieved CASTp data.
</p><p>
<b>Hide</b> hides the dialog without removing it;
<b>Quit</b> removes the dialog and the structure.
<b>Help</b> brings up this manual page in a browser window.
