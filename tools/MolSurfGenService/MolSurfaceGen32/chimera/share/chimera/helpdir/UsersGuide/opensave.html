<title>Open/Save Dialogs</title>
</head><body>
<h2>Open/Save Dialogs</h2>
<p>
Open/save dialogs are used for most file <a href="#opening">opening</a>
and <a href="#saving">saving</a> operations within Chimera.
Several features are common to all open/save dialogs, including
how directories are shown and <a href="#navigation">navigated</a>.
A given dialog may include additional features,
depending on the function or tool from which it is called
and whether opening or saving is being performed.
</p><p>
<a name="opendialog">
The Chimera <b>Open File</b> dialog is invoked by choosing
<b>File... Open</b> from the menu.
</a>
Any of the <a href="filetypes.html">registered file types</a> can be
opened from this dialog.
</p>
<table>
<tr><th>Chimera Open File Dialog</th></tr>
<tr><td><img src="open.png"></td></tr>
</table>
<p>
Certain buttons are common to most open/save dialogs.
<b>Open</b> or <b>Save</b> performs the indicated operation
and dismisses the dialog (although there is a checkbox option to
<b>Keep dialog up after Open</b>).
<b>Close</b> dismisses the dialog without performing the operation.
The <b>Help</b> button brings up a manual page in a browser window.
</p>

<a name="navigation">
<h3>Directory Navigation</h3></a>
<p>
By default,
the first open/save dialog to be invoked during a Chimera session
shows the information for the directory from which Chimera was started
(UNIX) or the directory of the most recent open/save operation (Windows).
This behavior is controlled by the <b>Open dialog starts in directory
from last session</b> setting
in the <a href="preferences.html#General"><b>General</b> preferences</a>.
The directory pathname is shown in the <b>Folder</b> field.
Other locations can be browsed by clicking a directory
name in any of the panels within the dialog;
the leftmost panel represents the top of the directory hierarchy,
and each panel going rightward represents the next lower level.
Recent directories can be
accessed using a pulldown menu to the right of the current directory
name (marked with a black triangle).
When a file is opened or saved, the directory pathname is added to the
recent directory list in the
<a href="preferences.html#preffile"><b>preferences</b> file</a>.
The recent directory list is shared by all open/save dialogs.
</p><p>
In some situations, loading all of the levels in the directory hierarchy
can be slow.
<a name="shortbrowse">
The size of open/save dialogs can be limited to the two lowest levels
</a>
by setting <b>Use short open/save browser</b> to <b>true</b>
in the <a href="preferences.html#General"><b>General</b> preferences</a>.
With this setting, open/save dialogs will contain
only the two lowest levels when:
<ul>
<li>first invoked within a session
(dialogs opened within a session before the preference
was changed will reopen in their previous state rather than
according to the preference)
<li>a different directory is chosen
</ul>
</p><p>
On Windows, shared file systems in the network neighborhood cannot be
browsed to directly, but can be accessed by entering
<blockquote>
<b>\\<i>hostname</i>\<i>share_folder_name</i></b>
</blockquote>
in the <b>Folder</b> field.  This enables browsing
within the share folder hierarchy.  Similarly, a full pathname
can be entered in the <b>File name</b> field, for example:
<blockquote>
<b>\\<i>hostname</i>\<i>share_folder_name</i>\<i>folder_name</i>\<i>filename</i></b>
</blockquote>
</p>

<a name="opening">
<h3>Opening Files</h3></a>
<p>
More than one file can be opened at a time.
After <a href="#navigation">navigation</a> to the desired directory,
individual filenames or blocks of filenames can be
chosen with the left mouse button.
<b>Ctrl</b>-click adds to an existing choice rather than replacing it.
To highlight a block of filenames without having to hold down the mouse button,
click on the first (or last) and then <b>Shift</b>-click on the
last (or first) in the desired block.
</p><p>
Only the files with <a href="filetypes.html#suffix">suffixes</a>
appropriate for the <b>File type</b> setting will be listed.  
In many cases, compressed files (*.gz, *.Z) of those types 
will also be listed and can be opened.
The possible <b>File type</b> settings vary depending on the specific dialog.
Any of the <a href="filetypes.html">registered file types</a> 
can be opened from the 
<a href="#opendialog"><b>Chimera Open File Dialog</b></a>;
if the <b>File type</b> is <b>all (ask type)</b> or <b>all (guess type)</b>,
all files will be listed.  If a tool-specific file type is opened, the
<a href="filetypes.html#associated">associated tool</a>
will be executed or started, if it has not been started already.
</p><p>
<a href="filetypes.html#prefix">Prefixes</a>
cannot be used, and there is no default file type.
If a file is one of the <a href="filetypes.html">registered types</a>
but is not named with the correct <a href="filetypes.html#suffix">suffix</a>,
it can be read by either <b>(A)</b> setting the <b>File type</b>
accordingly and entering the filename manually,
or <b>(B)</b> changing the <b>File type</b>
to <b>all (ask type)</b>, clicking on the filename or entering it manually,
and then indicating the file type when queried.
</p><p>
The names of recently opened files
are available from a pulldown menu to the right
of the <b>File name</b> field (marked with a black triangle).
When a file is opened, the file pathname is added to the recent file list.
The recent file list and the most recent <b>File type</b> setting for each
open dialog are stored in the
<a href="preferences.html#preffile"><b>preferences</b> file</a>.
</p><p>
<b>Open</b> opens the indicated file(s) and dismisses the dialog
unless <b>Keep dialog up after Open</b> is checked.
</p>

<a name="saving">
<h3>Saving Files</h3></a>
<p>
After <a href="#navigation">navigation</a> to the desired directory, the name
of the file to be saved should be entered in the <b>File name</b> field
(or chosen with the left mouse button, if a file of the same name already
exists).
The file types and contents that can be saved depend on
the function or tool from which the dialog is called.
A save dialog may include a checkbox option to
<b>Add <i>.xyz</i> suffix if none given</b>,
where <b><i>.xyz</i></b> is the default <a href="filetypes.html#suffix">
suffix</a> for the given <b>File type</b>.
When the option is on, a suffix will be added
only to a filename lacking a suffix; when the option is off,
suffixes will not be added automatically.
</p><p>
The names of recently saved files
are available from a pulldown menu to the right
of the <b>File name</b> field (marked with a black triangle).
When a file is saved, the file pathname is added to the recent file list.
The recent file list and the most recent <b>File type</b> setting for each
save dialog are stored in the
<a href="preferences.html#preffile"><b>preferences</b> file</a>.
</p><p>
<b>Save</b> saves the indicated file and dismisses the dialog.
