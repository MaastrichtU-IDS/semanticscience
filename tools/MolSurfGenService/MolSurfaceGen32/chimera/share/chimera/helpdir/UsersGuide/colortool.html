The <b>Color Editor</b> allows colors to be created interactively.
There are <a href="extension.html">several ways to start</a>
the <b>Color Editor</b>, a tool in the <b>Utilities</b> category.
</p><p>
Clicking a <a href="coloring.html#colorwell">color well</a>
opens the <b>Color Editor</b> (if it is not already open) 
and <b><i>activates</i></b> the well so that it reflects
any color changes within the <b>Color Editor</b>.
The border of the color well turns white to signify activation.
The color defined in the <b>Color Editor</b> can be:
<ul>
<li>applied using
<a href="menu.html#actcolor"><b>Actions... Color...  from editor</b></a>
<li> specified as <b>colorpanel</b>, <b>fromeditor</b>, or <b>editor</b>
in <a href="coloring.html">coloring</a> commands
<li> applied to any <a href="coloring.html#colorwell">color well</a>
in a Chimera dialog by dragging and dropping with the mouse
</ul>
A color may be defined in the RGB, HLS, HSV, CMYK, or Gray (grayscale)
<b>Color space</b>,
and may include transparency (opacity &lt 1).  In the RGB color space,
for example, there are sliders for the red, green, and blue components,
each ranging from 0 to 1.
If the small box marked <b>Opacity</b> is clicked, a slider for the opacity
value also appears.  The range of color in the bar under each slider is
adjusted to show what color would result from moving that slider to a
particular position in the bar while leaving the other sliders in place.
The resulting defined color is shown in
the top part of the <b>Color Editor</b> and applied to the items described
by the receiving color well (active color well or drag/drop target color well).
</p><p>
The <b>Color name</b> field shows a <a name="tkcode"><b>Tk color code</b></a>
consisting of "#" and 12 digits, 4 each for the red, green and blue
(RGB) components of a color.  Each component is expressed as a hexadecimal
number (allowable characters 0123456789abcdef) ranging from <b>0000</b> (0 in 
the decimal system) to <b>ffff</b> (65,535 in the decimal system).
Tk color codes can have different numbers of digits, 
but always a multiple of 3: if 3 digits total, then there is 1 digit
per color component with <b>f</b> meaning saturation; if 6 total, there are
2 digits per component with <b>ff</b> meaning saturation
(<a href="colortables.html#allcolors">examples</a>); and so on.
If a 3-, 6-, or 9-digit code is entered in the <b>Color name</b> field,
it will be expanded to 12 digits.  Rounding effects may be evident 
when a shorter, less precise code is expanded.
The Tk code reflects the RGB definition of the color shown at the top of
the <b>Color Editor</b>, regardless of the <b>Color space</b> setting.
Tk color codes do not include transparency information.
</p><p>
The <b>Color Editor</b> can be set to one of the
<a href="colortables.html">built-in colors</a>
by typing the name into the <b>Color name</b> field and hitting return.
The field will then revert to the corresponding Tk code.
</p><p>
Clicking the <b>No Color</b> button deletes the color assignments
of the items described by the active color well.
The ultimate result depends on the situation, because visible color
is determined by a <a href="hierarchy.html">hierarchy</a>.
Assigning "no color" at an overriding level reveals the colors
at the next level in the hierarchy.
For example, individual atom and bond colors overrule
color assigned at the model level; if "no color" is assigned to
a set of atoms, they will assume their model-level colors.
</p><p>
Colors can be saved in the <b><i>palette</i></b>,
the bar of rectangles near the the bottom of the <b>Color Editor</b>.
The currently defined color can be dragged from the top bar
to a palette slot; definitions of colors in the palette are saved in the
<a href="preferences.html#preffile"><b>preferences</b> file</a>.
Clicking a color in the palette makes it the currently defined color.
</p><p>
The <b>Help</b> button brings up this manual page in a browser window. 
<b>Close</b> dismisses the <b>Color Editor</b>.
