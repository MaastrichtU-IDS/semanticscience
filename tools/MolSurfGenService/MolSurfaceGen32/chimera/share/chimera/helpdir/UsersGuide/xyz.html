<h3>XYZ Format</h3>
<p>
XYZ files contain atomic coordinates.  While variants of the format exist, 
Chimera reads XYZ files that conform to the following:
<ul>
<li> First line: total number of atoms (optional)
<li> Second line: molecule name or comment (optional)
<li> All other lines: element symbol or atomic number, 
x, y, and z coordinates, separated by spaces, tabs, or commas
</ul>
Example:

XYZ files can be opened in many ways, like other 
<a href="filetypes.html">registered file types</a>.  The file type can be
indicated with a suffix (<b>.xyz</b>, part of the filename)
or a prefix (<b>xyz:</b>, not part of the filename).
