<title>Mouse Manipulation of Models</title>
</head><body>
<h2>Mouse Manipulation of Models</h2>
<p>
The <b>X axis</b> is horizontal in the plane of the
screen, the <b>Y axis</b> is vertical in the plane of the screen, and the
<b>Z axis</b> is perpendicular to the plane of the screen.
By <b><i>default</i></b>, using a three-button mouse
(although <a href="#2button">fewer buttons</a> can be workable),
models are:
<ul>
<li><b>rotated</b> with the left mouse button
in the graphics window.  Rotation is about the
<b>X</b> and/or <b>Y</b> axis when the cursor is in the central region
of the graphics window (the cursor becomes a small circle) and
about the <b>Z</b> axis when the cursor is in the periphery of the
graphics window (the cursor becomes two curved arrows in yin-yang
configuration).  The center of rotation can be adjusted with the
<a href="sideview.html#rotation"><b>Rotation</b> tool</a> or the command 
<a href="midas/cofr.html"><b>cofr</b></a>.
<br><br>
<li><b>XY-translated</b> with the middle mouse button
(the cursor will look like a cross formed by two double-headed arrows).
On <b>Windows</b>, depending on the mouse setup,
<a href="ntmouse.html">an adjustment</a> may be required.
<br><br>
<li><b>scaled</b> with the right mouse button (the cursor will look
like a diagonal double-headed arrow enclosing a small square);
movements downward and/or to the right increase the scale,
whereas movements upward and/or to the left decrease it.
Interactive scaling can also be performed 
by rolling a mouse's scroll wheel or by dragging the small square in the
<a href="sideview.html#sideview"><b>Side View</b></a> horizontally.
<br><br>
<li><b>Z-translated</b> with <b>Ctrl</b>-middle mouse button 
(the cursor will look like a vertical double-headed arrow);
movements downward and/or to the right translate
structures closer, and movements upward and/or to the left
translate structures farther away.  Note that Z-translation is not the same
as scaling.
</ul>
<a name="othermouse">
Also by <b><i>default</i></b></a>, 
<ul>
<li><b>Ctrl</b>-left mouse button performs 
<a href="selection.html#pickselect">picking</a> 
(selection from the graphics window); 
the cursor will look like a pointing hand.
<br><br>
<li><b>Ctrl</b>-right mouse button allows repositioning
atom and residue labels (those shown with the
<a href="menu.html#actlabel"><b>Actions... Label</b></a> menu or
the commands <a href="midas/label.html"><b>label</b></a>
and <a href="midas/rlabel.html"><b>rlabel</b></a>).
The movement is in the plane of the screen (X/Y), or along Z if
the <b>Shift</b> key is also pressed.
<br><br>
<li>Placing the mouse cursor close to an atom or bond (without
clicking any buttons) will cause the corresponding label information 
to appear in an <b>atomspec balloon</b>.  Similarly, many dialogs 
include <b>balloon help</b>, additional text that is displayed 
when the cursor is paused near some relevant part of the dialog.
Whether these balloons should appear can be set in the
<a href="preferences.html#General"><b>General</b> preferences</a>.
</ul>
Mouse button assignments can be changed in the
<a href="preferences.html#Mouse"><b>Mouse</b> preferences</a>.
</p><p>
Additionally holding down the <b>Shift</b> key reduces the speed
(mouse sensitivity) of manipulations in the main window and
<a href="sideview.html#sideview"><b>Side View</b></a> by a factor of 10.

<h3>Activation for Motion</h3>
</a>
A model must be <b><i>active</i></b> (activated for motion)
to move in response to mouse manipulations.  Models are active by default.
Toggling model activation status allows users to manually position 
one model relative to another.  Models can be activated/deactivated using:
<ul>
<li>the <b>A</b>(ctive) checkboxes or activation 
<a href="modelpanel.html#functions">function buttons</a>
in the <a href="modelpanel.html"><b>Model Panel</b></a>
<li>the checkboxes under the 
<a href="chimerawindow.html#emulator"><b> Command Line</b></a>
<li>the command <a href="midas/select.html#older"><b>select</b></a>
</ul>

<a name="2button">
<h3>One- and Two-Button Mice</h3>
</a>
<p>
On a <b>Mac</b> with a one-button mouse, buttons 2 and 3 can be emulated
with the <b>option</b> and
<img src="icon-clover.png" height=12px width=12px> (apple) keys, respectively.
For example, click-dragging with the <b>option</b> key pressed
performs XY-translation (assuming default
<a href="preferences.html#Mouse"><b>Mouse</b> preferences</a>).
In Mac OS 10.5 (Leopard), emulation of a 3-button mouse is off by default, 
but can be turned on in the <b>Input</b> section of the <b>X11</b> preferences.
</p><p>
A two-button mouse is also workable.
Starting with the default mappings,
if the right button of a two-button mouse is not already
performing XY-translation, use the
<a href="preferences.html#Mouse"><b>Mouse</b> preferences</a>
to reassign XY-translation to button 3. The right button of a
two-button mouse should then work for XY-translation, leaving
the left button for rotation (the default).
Scaling can be performed with the
<a href="sideview.html#sideview"><b>Side View</b></a>
or the command <a href="midas/scale.html"><b>scale</b></a>
instead of with the mouse.

<h3>Other Input Devices</h3>
</a>
<p>
Chimera also supports the 
<a href="http://www.3dconnexion.com/" target="_blank">3Dconnexion</a>
SpaceNavigator<small><sup>TM</sup></small>
input device.  
Thanks to Thomas Margraf (University of Hamburg) for the Linux implementation.
Other 3Dconnexion devices such as the SpaceExplorer<small><sup>TM</sup></small>
may also work.  The 3Dconnexion driver must be installed.
Besides a cap that can be tilted, rotated, and pushed/pulled in 
any direction, the SpaceNavigator<small><sup>TM</sup></small>
has two buttons with the possible Chimera functions:
<ul>
<li><b>Button 1</b> or <b>Fit</b> centers the models 
and scales them to fit in the window
<li><b>Button 2</b> toggles a mode allowing 
simultaneous rotation and translation (the default 
<a name="dominant"><b><i>dominant mode</b></i></a>
only allows rotation or translation depending on which user motion
has the larger amplitude)
</ul>
The <b>Zoom Direction</b> controls how the cap coordinate system relates
to the screen coordinate system:
<ul>
<li> when <b>up/down</b> cap motion zooms the models, 
the tabletop plane maps to the plane of the screen; 
the systems are related by a rotation of approximately 90&deg;
<li> when <b>closer/farther</b> cap motion zooms the models, 
the systems are approximately aligned
</ul>
Zoom direction and other settings are shown in system dialogs
(for example, the Windows Control Panel or Mac System Preferences), 
although some of the Mac controls appear to have no effect.
</p><p>
<a href="../ContributedSoftware/accelerators/accelerators.html">Accelerators</a>
(keyboard shortcuts) for changing 
SpaceNavigator<small><sup>TM</sup></small> behaviors:
<ul>
<li><b>na</b> - toggle between moving all models and moving only the 
<a href="#activedef">active</a> models
<li><b>nd</b> - toggle between <a href="#dominant">dominant mode</a> 
and allowing simultaneous rotation and translation
<li><b>nf</b> - toggle <b><i>fly-through mode</i></b>, 
where the device moves the viewpoint rather than the models
(as if all axes were reversed); currently hard to control
<li><b>nz</b> - toggle whether model in/out motion is true zooming
(scaling the entire scene) or Z-translation (moving models relative 
to the front and back clipping planes)
</ul>
Accelerators are disabled by default.  One way to enable their use is
with the command <a href="midas/ac.html"><b>ac</b></a>.
