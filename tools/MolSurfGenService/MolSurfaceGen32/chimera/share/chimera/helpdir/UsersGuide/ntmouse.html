<h2>Windows - Middle Mouse Button Workaround</h2>
<p>
The default Chimera middle mouse button assignment
of <a href="mouse.html"><b>XY-translation</b></a>
may not work on Windows systems using Logitech MouseWare.
The middle mouse button is set to perform autoscrolling
and does not get reassigned automatically to XY-translation
within Chimera.  To solve this, change the Logitech setting for the
middle mouse button from <b>Universal Scroll</b> to <b>Generic Button</b>.
