<h3><a href="usageconventions.html">Usage</a>:
 <BR><b>mask</b> <i>volume-model</i> <i>surf-models</i>
<a href="#options"><i>options</i></a></h3>
<p>
The <b>mask</b> command extracts a 
<a href="../filetypes.html#volume">volume data</a>
subregion bounded by surfaces (<a href="#algorithm">details...</a>).
All kinds of <a href="../surfattrib.html#surfmodels">surface models</a>
can be used, but not surfaces in <a href="../vrmlattrib.html">VRML models</a>.
The new data set can be saved to a file using 
<a href="../../ContributedSoftware/volumeviewer/framevolumeviewer.html"
target="_top"><b>Volume Viewer</b></a>
or the command <a href="volume.html"><b>volume</b></a>.

<b>Icosahedron Surface</b></a>,

</p><p>
<i>Volume-model</i> is the model number (preceded by #)
of the starting volume data set.
A new data set will be generated and opened as a different model.
</p><p>
<i>Surf-models</i> specifies the bounding surface(s) 
and can be one or more comma-separated model numbers (preceded by #) 
or the word <b>sel</b> to indicate the currently
<a href="../selection.html">selected</a> surfaces or 
<a href="../surfattrib.html#surfpiecedef">surface pieces</a>.

<a name="options">
<h4>Options</h4>
</a>
Option keywords for <b>mask</b>
can be truncated to unique strings, and their case does not matter.
Synonyms for true: True, 1.  Synonyms for false: False, 0.
A vertical bar "|" designates mutually exclusive options, and
default settings are indicated with <b>bold</b>.
<blockquote>
  <a name="axis">
  <tt><b>axis</b> <i>x,y,z</i></tt></a>
  <br>Projection axis vector (default is along the data Y axis: <b>0,1,0</b>).
  This is relevant when the surfaces have holes.
  The region between surface layers is computed along the specified axis 
  (see <a href="#algorithm">algorithm</a>).  Vector coordinates 
  <i>x,y,z</i> are relative to the untransformed data. 
  The vector can point in any direction 
  (need not be parallel to the X, Y, or Z axis) 
  and need not be of unit length.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <a name="fullmap">
  <tt><b>fullmap</b> true|<b>false</b></tt></a>
  <br>
  Make the masked volume data set have the same dimensions as the original 
  volume data set.  Otherwise, the bounds will be set as small as possible
  to enclose the surfaces, and the masked volume may be smaller.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <tt><b>pad</b> <i>distance</i></tt>
  <br>Before computing the masked volume, move the surface by the specified
  <i>distance</i> along the surface normals.  This allows extracting a larger 
  or smaller region than is enclosed by the original surface.
  Positive or negative values can be used, and the units of length
  are the same as for the data (generally &Aring; or nm).
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <a name="slab">
  <tt><b>slab</b> <i>width</i>|<i>d1</i>,<i>d2</i></tt></a>
  <br>Extract a slab of data around a surface layer.  Two additional
  surfaces, displaced as specified from the existing surface and joined at 
  their edges (if any), are computed but not displayed.  Data for voxels
  between the computed surfaces are retained.  If a single value
  (<i>width</i>) is supplied, the two computed surfaces are offset
  along the normals of the original surface by &plusmn;&frac12;(<i>width</i>).
  Alternatively, two values separated by a comma but no spaces can be used
  to specify the offsets of the two surfaces independently.
  Positive or negative values can be used, and the units of length
  are the same as for the data (generally &Aring; or nm).
  The basic <a href="#algorithm">algorithm</a> applies, except that
  the original surface is replaced by the pair of computed surfaces.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <a name="sandwich">
  <tt><b>sandwich</b> <b>true</b>|false</tt></a>
  <br>Include only volume voxels lying between two surface layers. Otherwise,
  the volume projected along the axis beyond a single surface layer will also
  be included (see <a href="#algorithm">algorithm</a>).
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <a name="invertMask">
  <tt><b>invertMask</b> true|<b>false</b></tt></a>
  <br>Include the opposite data, the spatial complement of what would
  otherwise be included.

<h4>
Mask Algorithm
</h4></a>
<p>
The masked volume is computed by looking at intercepts of lines 
parallel to the <a href="#axis">projection axis</a> with the surfaces.  
For a given line, the volume data between the 1st and 2nd,
3rd and 4th, 5th and 6th, ... intercepts are included in the masked volume,
while those between the 2nd and 3rd, 4th and 5th, ... are excluded.  The
intercepts are computed for lines through points on a rectangular grid
normal to the projection axis with spacing equal to the minimum
grid plane spacing of the volume data set.  For each volume voxel, the
intercepts of the closest grid line are used to determine inclusion in the
masked volume.  If there is an odd number of intercept points, then
points beyond the final intercept are included in the masked volume unless
the <a href="#sandwich"><b>sandwich</b></a> option is used.  
In the new data set, values outside the masked region are set to zero
and those inside are set to the original volume values.
The grid points of the calculated volume align exactly with those of
the original volume.
The bounds are set to minimally enclose the surfaces
unless the <a href="#fullmap"><b>fullmap</b></a> option is used.
The full size of the original volume data set is used
even if only a subregion is being displayed.
