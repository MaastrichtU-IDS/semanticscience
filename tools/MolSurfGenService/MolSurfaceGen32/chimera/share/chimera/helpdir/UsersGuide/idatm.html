<title>Atom Types in Chimera</title>
</head><body>
<h3>Atom Types in Chimera</h3>
<p>
Atom types are classifications based on element and bonding environment.
Atom type assignments are used in functional group identification,
<a href="../ContributedSoftware/addh/addh.html">hydrogen addition</a>,
and <a href="../ContributedSoftware/findhbond/findhbond.html">hydrogen bond
identification</a>, and to determine <a href="midas/vdwrad.html">VDW radii</a>.
</p><p>
Chimera uses atom and residue names, or if these are not "standard,"
the coordinates of atoms, to determine connectivity and atom types.
Errors in atom-type assignment may occur, especially in
low-resolution structures and unusual functional groups.
Atom type assignments can be displayed as labels (for example, with 
<a href="menu.html#actlabel"><b>Actions...  Label... IDATM type</b></a>) 
and changed with the command
<a href="midas/setattr.html"><b>setattr</b></a>.
</p><p>
The algorithm and atom types discerned
are adapted from the program IDATM; for a detailed
description of IDATM and validation testing, please see

The atom types and algorithm, including extensions of the original method,
are described briefly below.  Where type definitions are not mutually exclusive,
the atom is assigned the most specific type possible; for example, although
a carboxylate carbon is also <i>sp</i><sup>2</sup>-hybridized, 
it is assigned the <b>Cac</b>
type.  Since the categorizations in Chimera differ from those in the original
method, the same type may appear in more than one row in the following table.

<h3>Atom-Type Identification Algorithm</h3>
<p>
Brief descriptions of the original algorithm and further steps
added during implementation in Chimera are given here.</p>
<p>
Many experimentally determined structures of molecules do not include
hydrogen atoms.  IDATM uses the coordinates of nonhydrogen atoms (plus
any hydrogens, if present) to determine the connectivity and hybridization
states of atoms within molecules.  This knowledge is essential for detailed
molecular modeling.  The algorithm is hierarchical; the "easiest"
assignments are done first and used to aid subsequent assignments. 
The procedure can be divided into several stages:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<b>Heavy Atom Valence (HAV).</b>
Elements are determined from atom names, and 
<a name="connectivity">atoms are considered bonded</a>
if the distance between them is no greater than the sum of their 
<a href="../ContributedSoftware/editing/covrad.html">covalent bond radii</a>
plus a tolerance of 0.4 &Aring;.  Atoms are sorted according to the
number of nonhydrogen atoms they are bonded to; this will be referred to as
heavy atom valence.
<li>
<b>Fully Determined Atoms and Atoms With HAV > 1.</b>
The types of some atoms may already be fully determined at this stage; for
example, HAV 4 carbons must be <i>sp</i><sup>3</sup>-hybridized.  Distinctions are
also made on the bases of number of attached oxygens.  The average of the
three bond angles about each HAV 3 atom is calculated and used to assign the
type of the central atom.  The average bond angle has been found to be a
reliable indicator of hybridization state.  Only one bond angle is available
for HAV 2 atoms, and this is a less reliable indicator; HAV 2 carbon and
nitrogen atoms are assigned types based on the angle but are marked for
further examination.
<li>
<b>Atoms with HAV = 1.</b>
The only geometric information available for HAV 1 atoms is bond length.
Types are assigned based on bond length and the type of the partner atom.
<li>
<b>Resolution of Ambiguities and Identification of Charged Groups.</b>
Atoms tagged for further examination in the second stage are retyped,
if necessary, using bond length information.  Next, functional groups
likely to be charged at physiological pH are identified:
<i>sp</i><sup>3</sup>-hybridized nitrogens bonded only to 
<i>sp</i><sup>3</sup>-hybridized
carbons and/or hydrogens are assigned a positively charged type;
guanidinium groups are identified; carboxylate and nitro groups are
identified.  Finally, isolated <i>sp</i><sup>2</sup>-hybridized carbons (bonded
to only <i>sp</i><sup>3</sup>-hybridized atoms) are retyped as 
<i>sp</i><sup>3</sup>-hybridized carbons.
</ol>
<p>
In Chimera, a few additional distinctions are made.  Carbons that are
<i>sp</i><sup>2</sup>-hybridized and part of planar ring systems 
are given an aromatic type.  
Oxygens within aromatic rings are given an aromatic type.
Geometric criteria are used to subdivide <i>sp</i><sup>2</sup>-hybridized
nitrogens into double-bonded (or aromatic) and non-double-bonded categories.
Sulfone and sulfoxide sulfurs are given
two different types rather than lumped into a single category,
as are resonance-equivalent terminal oxygens sharing formal negative charge.
</p><p>
Some types depend on protonation states, and more information is used 
to determine the protonation states of groups with pKa values close to 7:  
<ul>
<li> The types of nitrogens in histidine sidechains may be adjusted when
<a href="../ContributedSoftware/addh/addh.html"><b>AddH</b></a> (or the
command <a href="midas/addh.html"><b>addh</b></a>) determines
histidine protonation states. 
<li> When a phosphate group has three terminal oxygens 
(bonded only to the phosphorus), if one P&ndash;O bond is at 
least 0.05 &Aring; longer than each of the others, that oxygen will be typed as
<b>O3</b> instead of <b>O3&ndash;</b>. 
A terminal <b>O3</b> oxygen will be protonated if/when hydrogens are added, 
whereas terminal <b>O3&ndash;</b> oxygens will not.
</ul>
