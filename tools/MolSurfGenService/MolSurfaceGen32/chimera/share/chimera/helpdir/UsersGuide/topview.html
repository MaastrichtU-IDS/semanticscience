<h3>Top View</h3>

<p>
In the <a href="sideview.html#sideview"><b>Side View</b></a>,
setting <b>View</b> to <b>top</b> shows the relationship between
the viewer and the Chimera scene from the top.  This <b>Top View</b>
allows perspective and stereo parameters to be adjusted interactively.
These and additional related parameters can be changed numerically in the 
<a href="sideview.html#camera"><b>Camera</b></a> tool.
<ul>
<li> The <b>horizontal field of view</b> is the angle formed by
the lines emanating from the eye position
when <a href="sideview.html#projection">perspective</a> is being used.
This angle can be adjusted by dragging one of the red lines with
the left mouse button or dragging the eye position horizontally
with the middle mouse button.
<br><br>
<li> When stereo is on, the <b>eye separation</b> can be adjusted by dragging
the eye position vertically with the middle mouse button.
<br><br>
<li> The vertical dashed line represents the plane of the screen
(the so-called <a href="sideview.html#focal">focal plane</a>).
When viewed in stereo,
items in front of the focal plane will appear to project from the screen
and items behind it will appear to recede behind the screen.
Dragging the dashed line with the left mouse button moves
the focal plane relative to the items in view.  At the same time,
the eye position will adjust (changing the apparent scale)
to keep the <b>distance to screen</b> constant.
</ul>
The <b>eye separation</b> and <b>distance to screen</b>   
govern the parallax between the left- and right-eye views.
The <b>horizontal field of view</b> and <b>distance to screen</b>
are interdependent; changing one changes the other, in the opposite
direction (<a href="sideview.html#stereoparm">details...</a>).
</p><p>
The scale, <a href="stereo.html#modedef">camera mode</a>, and 
<a href="clipping.html#global">global clipping planes</a>
can be adjusted just as in the 
standard <a href="sideview.html#sideview"><b>Side View</b></a>.
