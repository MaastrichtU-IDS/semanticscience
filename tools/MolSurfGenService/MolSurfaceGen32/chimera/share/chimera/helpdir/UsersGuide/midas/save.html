<h3><a href="usageconventions.html">Usage</a>:
 <BR><b>save</b> [ <i>session_name</i>.py ] </h3>
<p>
<b>Save</b> saves
a <a href="../sessions.html#sesdef">Chimera session</a>.
If <i>session_name</i> is omitted, a <a href="../opensave.html">dialog</a>
for specifying the name and location will appear.
A session file consists of Python code that reconstitutes the state
of Chimera by displaying data and performing other operations;
if no <b>.py</b> suffix is entered, it will be added to the name
automatically.
</p><p>
Molecular coordinate and sequence alignment data are included in the
session file; however, volume data files must still
be present to restart a session in which they were open.
When a session with volume data is restarted,
the user may be queried about file location(s)
if the data or the session file have been moved since the session was saved.
</p><p>
There are multiple ways to
<a href="../sessions.html#savesess">save sessions</a> and
<a href="../sessions.html#restartsess">restart sessions</a>.
