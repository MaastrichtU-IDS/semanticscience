<h3><a href="usageconventions.html">Usage</a>:
 <BR><b>matrixget</b> [ <i>filename</i> ] </h3>
<h3><a href="usageconventions.html">Usage</a>:
 <BR><b>matrixset</b> [ <i>filename</i> ] </h3>
<p>
<b>Matrixget</b> writes the current transformation matrices
to a file named <i>filename</i>.  
<b>Matrixset</b> reads matrices from the file named <i>filename</i> 
(in the format written by <b>matrixget</b>)
and applies transformations accordingly.
If <i>filename</i> is omitted, a <a href="../opensave.html">dialog</a>
for specifying the name and location will appear.
For <b>matrixget</b> only, if a single dash is used as the <i>filename</i>,
the matrix information will be sent to the <a href="../reply.html"><b>Reply
Log</b></a>.
</p><p>
Each matrix is of the form
<pre>
Model 0.0
	0.688816 0.672651 -0.270321 -3.40168
	0.327689 0.0437142 0.943774 1.87208
	0.646647 -0.738668 -0.190309 11.6143
</pre>
where the first line indicates <i>model.submodel</i> number
(with submodel number of zero for models not subdivided into 
<a href="atom_spec.html#subcats">submodels</a>).
The next three lines begin with tabs and contain a 3x3 rotation matrix
and (in the fourth column) a translation vector.  Scale is not specified.
</p><p>
When multiple models are present, multiple matrices will be written to/read
from the same file.  An error message will appear
if there is no model present for one or more of the
matrices read with <b>matrixset</b>.
