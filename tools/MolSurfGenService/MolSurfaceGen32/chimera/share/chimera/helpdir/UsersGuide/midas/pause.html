<h3><a href="usageconventions.html">Usage</a>:
<br><b>pause</b></h3>
<p>
<b>Pause</b> suspends
<a href="../indexcommand.html#cmdfile">command script</a> execution
until the user presses any key other than <b>Esc</b> or <b>End</b>. 
When a pause initiated with the command <b>pause</b> is in effect, 
pressing <b>End</b> will abort script execution.
The pause will not be included in any 
<a href="../movies.html">movie</a> that is being recorded,
because no new frames are drawn during that time;
to generate pauses in a movie,
<b><A href="wait.html">wait</A></b> should be used instead.
</p><p>
Alternatively (without use of the <b>pause</b> command),
command script execution can be paused/resumed by pressing
<b>Shift</b>-<b>Esc</b> or aborted by pressing <b>Esc</b>.
