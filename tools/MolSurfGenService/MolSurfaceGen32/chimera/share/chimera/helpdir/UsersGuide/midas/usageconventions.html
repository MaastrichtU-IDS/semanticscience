<h3>Chimera Command Usage Conventions</h3> 
<p>
In the <b>Usage</b> sections of
<a href="../framecommand.html" target="_top">Chimera command</a> 
manual pages:
<ul>
<li> <b>keywords</b> to be taken literally are not italicized
<li> <b><i>parameters</i></b> that should be replaced with 
an appropriate value (such as a number or word) are italicized
<li><b><i>atom-spec</i></b> refers to an
<a href="frameatom_spec.html" target="_top">atom specification string</a>,
which generally specifies "all" when left blank
<li> optional keywords and parameters are referred to as
<b><i>options</i></b> or are enclosed in square brackets: <b>[&nbsp;]</b> 
<li> mutually exclusive choices are separated by a vertical bar: <b>|</b>
<li> mutually exclusive choices of a required item are grouped with
parentheses: <b>(&nbsp;)</b>
</ul>
The brackets, vertical bars, and parentheses mentioned above are 
merely symbolic and should not be included in the typed command.
</p><p>
All commands can be truncated to unique strings. Keyword truncation is not 
allowed unless a command's manual page states otherwise.
</p><p>
Multiple commands can be combined on a single line, separated by semicolons.
This may be useful because the display 
is not redrawn until the last command in a semicolon-separated series 
has been executed; that is, multiple graphical changes such as changes in 
representation, color, and display state can be made to appear 
simultaneously instead of one by one.
