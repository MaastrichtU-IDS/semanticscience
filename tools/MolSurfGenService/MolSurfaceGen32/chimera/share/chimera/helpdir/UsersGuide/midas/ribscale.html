<h3><a href="usageconventions.html">Usage</a>:
 <br><b>ribscale</b> <i>scaling</i>
<a href="frameatom_spec.html" target="_top"><i>atom-spec</i></a></h3>
<p>
<b>Ribscale</b> controls which ribbon 
<a href="../../ContributedSoftware/ribbonstyle/ribbonstyle.html#scaling">scaling</a> (named set of secondary-structure-specific dimensions) is used.
Possible <i>scaling</i> settings include:
    <ul>
     <li><b>Chimera default</b> - varies with secondary structure; 
     beta-strand directionality is shown with arrowheads
     <li><b>licorice</b> - does not vary with secondary structure
    </ul>
Their definitions can be viewed in the
<a href="../../ContributedSoftware/ribbonstyle/ribbonstyle.html"><b>Ribbon
Style Editor</b></a>.  Additional 
<a href="../../ContributedSoftware/ribbonstyle/ribbonstyle.html#scaling">scalings</a> created and named with the
<a href="../../ContributedSoftware/ribbonstyle/ribbonstyle.html"><b>Ribbon
Style Editor</b></a> can also be used.
Other ways to switch among ribbon scalings are with
the <A href="../inspection.html"><b>Selection Inspector</b></a> and the
<a href="../moleculeattrib.html">molecule model attributes panel</a>.
</p><p>
Scaling names containing spaces should be enclosed in single or double 
quote marks, for example:
<blockquote><tt>
<b>ribscale "Chimera default" :1-8.b</b>
</tt></blockquote>
Even if only particular atoms are <a href="frameatom_spec.html" target="_top">
specified</a>, the ribbon segment(s) corresponding to the
entire residue(s) containing the atoms will be affected.
</p><p>
<b>Known problem</b>: reassigning secondary structure
(for example, by using <a href="ksdssp.html"><b>ksdssp</b></a>)
sets the scaling of some residues to <b>Chimera default</b>;  
any other scalings previously in effect need to be reapplied.
