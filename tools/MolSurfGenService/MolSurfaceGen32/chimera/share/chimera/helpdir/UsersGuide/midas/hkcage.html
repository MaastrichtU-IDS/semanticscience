<h3><a href="usageconventions.html">Usage</a>:
 <BR><b>hkcage</b> <i>h</i> <i>k</i> 
<a href="#options"><i>options</i></a></h3>
<p>
The <b>hkcage</b> command creates a mesh of hexagons and pentagons to
represent the arrangement of proteins in an icosahedral virus capsid.  
The related tool 
<a href="../../ContributedSoftware/icosahedron/icosahedron.html">
<b>Icosahedron Surface</b></a> generates a mesh of triangles
rather than hexagons and pentagons.

</p><p>
The arrangement of subunits in an icosahedral capsid can be described
as a sheet of hexagons in which curvature is introduced by replacing 
certain hexagons with pentagons, as in a geodesic dome.
The pentagons occupy the points of the icosahedron, while 
the indices <i>h</i> and <i>k</i> refer to the number and arrangement 
of hexagons in each face.  A virus T number
(T = <i>h</i><sup>2</sup> + <i>hk</i> + <i>k</i><sup>2</sup>)
is proportional to the number of subunits in the capsid.
<a href="http://viperdb.scripps.edu/" target="_blank">VIPERdb</a> 
includes viruses with T = 1, 3, 4, 7, 13, and in a few cases, even higher.  
For more details, see the
<a href="http://viperdb.scripps.edu/icos_server.php?icspage=paradigm"
target="_blank">VIPERdb description</a> and the following reference:

The required arguments <i>h</i> and <i>k</i> can each be zero 
(but not both zero) or a positive integer.  
The calculation can be slow if large values are used.
</p><p>
The mesh is created as a new <a href="../surfattrib.html#surfmodels">surface 
model</a> centered at (0,0,0).
Hexagons are bent where they cross from one triangular face 
of the icosahedron to another, so that certain "hexagon" edges 
are formed by two straight line segments rather than one.

<h4>Options</h4>
</a>
Option keywords for <b>hkcage</b></a>
can be truncated to unique strings, and their case does not matter.
Synonyms for true: True, 1.  Synonyms for false: False, 0.
A vertical bar "|" designates mutually exclusive options, and
default settings are indicated with <b>bold</b>.
<blockquote>
  <b>radius</b> <i>r</i>
  <br>The radius <i>r</i> is the distance from the center of the icosahedron
  to a 5-fold vertex (default <b>100.0</b>).
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <b>orientation</b> <i>type</i>
  <br>The <i>type</i> of icosahedral orientation can be:
  <ul>
  <li><b>222</b> (default)
   - with two-fold symmetry axes along the X, Y, and Z axes
  <li>2n5 - with two-fold symmetry along X and 5-fold along Z
  <li>n25 - with two-fold symmetry along Y and 5-fold along Z
  <li>2n3 - with two-fold symmetry along X and 3-fold along Z
  <li>222r - same as 222 except rotated 90&deg; about Z
  <li>2n5r - same as 2n5 except rotated 180&deg; about Y
  <li>n25r - same as n25 except rotated 180&deg; about X
  <li>2n3r - same as 2n3 except rotated 180&deg; about Y
  </ul>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <b>color</b> <i>mesh-color</i>
  <br>The <i>mesh-color</i> can be any
  <a href="color.html#colorname">color name</a>
  that specifies a single color (default <b>white</b>).
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <b>linewidth</b> <i>width</i>
  <br>The <i>width</i> is the pixel linewidth of the mesh display
  (default <b>1.0</b>).
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <b>sphere</b> <i>f</i>
  <br>The sphere factor <i>f</i> is the weight of the sphere component in an
  interpolation between an icosahedron and a sphere of equal radius.
  It ranges from the default of <b>0.0</b> (icosahedron) to 1.0 (sphere).
  The interpolation only involves vertex positions and will not generate
  curved mesh lines.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <b>replace</b> <b>true</b>|false
  <br>Whether to replace an existing <b>hkcage</b> mesh with
  the new one rather than opening an additional model.
