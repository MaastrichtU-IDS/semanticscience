<title>Custom Residue Labeling</title>
</head><body>

<h2>Custom Residue Labeling</h2>
<p>
Choosing <b>Actions... Label... residue... custom...</b> from
the <a href="menu.html">Chimera menu</a> opens the
dialog for custom residue labeling.
</p><p>
The <b>Residue label</b> field contains <b><i>substitution codes</i></b> and 
arbitrary text representing the composition of the label.  
A substitution code is of the form <b>%(<i>descriptor</i>)s</b> where
<i>descriptor</i> can be any of the following:
<ul>
<li><b>name</b> - residue name
<li><b>1-letter code</b> - one-letter residue code for standard amino
acids, residue name for other residues
<li><b>specifier</b> - residue number, insertion code, and chain ID
<li><b>number</b> - residue number
<li><b>insertion code</b> - residue insertion code
<li><b>chain</b> - chain ID
</ul>
or the name of any
<a href="midas/atom_spec.html#resprops">residue attribute</a>.
Clicking the button for a descriptor inserts its substitution 
code at the current cursor position in the <b>Residue label</b> field.
Arbitrary text, including spaces, can be entered before, after, and between
substitution codes, and substitution codes can be entered manually.
</p><p>
The following would label lysine, residue 8 in chain C
as "wt&nbsp;K8":
<blockquote><tt>
<b>wt %(1-letter code)s%(number)s</b>
</tt></blockquote>
<p>
If the custom label definition includes a descriptor that is not
applicable to a particular residue (not all residues have an insertion 
code or chain ID, for example), nothing will be inserted in that 
part of the label for that residue.
</p><p>
<b>OK</b> performs the labeling and dismisses the dialog,
whereas <b>Apply</b> performs the labeling without dismissing the dialog.
<b>Close</b> simply dismisses the dialog. <b>Help</b> opens
this manual page in a browser window.
