<title>Formatted Gaussian Checkpoint Files</title>
</head><body>
<h2>Formatted Gaussian Checkpoint Files</h2>
<p>
Chimera can read molecular structures from formatted Gaussian checkpoint files.
This file type is indicated by the filename suffix <b>.fchk</b>
or by using <b><i>prefix:filename</i></b> in the command line,
where <b><i>prefix</i></b> is <b>fchk</b> or <b>gaussian</b>.
</p><p>
The <b>Atomic numbers</b> and <b>Current cartesian coordinates</b>
sections of the file are read to generate the structure.
All atoms are placed in a single residue
named UNK, and the atoms are named by element and the number
of atoms of that element encountered so far.  Coordinates expressed in
bohrs are converted to &Aring;.
</p><p>
If there is a <b>Mulliken Charges</b> section, 
<ul>
<li>the values are assigned as atom
<a href="../ContributedSoftware/defineattrib/defineattrib.html#attribdef">attributes</a>
named <b>charge</b> and <b>mullikenCharge</b>
<li>the molecule model 
<a href="../ContributedSoftware/defineattrib/defineattrib.html#attribdef">attribute</a>
<b>chargeModel</b> is assigned the value <b>Mulliken</b>
</ul>
