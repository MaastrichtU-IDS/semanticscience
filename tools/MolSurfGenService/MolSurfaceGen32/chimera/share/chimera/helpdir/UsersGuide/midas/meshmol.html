<h3><a href="usageconventions.html">Usage</a>:
 <BR><b>meshmol</b> <i>surf-model</i> <i>stick-radius</i> </h3>
<p>
The <b>meshmol</b> command creates a molecule model from a surface.
This allows mesh display as cylindrical sticks, whereas
surface model meshes can only be shown as lines.
<b>Meshmol</b> works on all kinds of
<a href="../surfattrib.html#surfmodels">surface models</a>,
but not on surfaces in <a href="../vrmlattrib.html">VRML models</a>.
</p><p>
<i>Surf-model</i> is the model number of the surface, optionally 
preceded by #.
</p><p>
A new molecule model is created in which the "bonds" (the mesh lines in
the surface model) are shown as sticks of the specified <i>stick-radius</i>.  
It is colored to match the surface coloring, which could be a single
color or different colors for different vertices.
The molecule model is also a
<a href="../../ContributedSoftware/volumepathtracer/framevolpath.html" 
target="_top">marker set</a>.
</p><p>
<b><i>Advantages</i></b> of treating a surface as a molecule
include the ability to display sticks, as mentioned above,
and to perform other operations available for atoms and bonds, 
including <a href="../savemodel.html">saving coordinates</a> to a file.
Further, since the molecule model is a
<a href="../../ContributedSoftware/volumepathtracer/framevolpath.html" 
target="_top">marker set</a>,
<a href="../../ContributedSoftware/volumepathtracer/framevolpath.html" 
target="_top"><b>Volume Tracer</b></a> can be used to control its
display and save it as a <a href="../../ContributedSoftware/volumepathtracer/volumepathtracer.html#markerfiles">marker file</a>.
Marker files include colors and radii in addition to coordinates.
</p><p>
<b><i>Disadvantages</i></b> relate to
the creation of physically unreasonable molecules
with very large numbers of atoms and bonds.
Chimera performs chemical perception, which may take up to hours in the
presence of huge numbers of small rings.  This essentially freezes the
program.  Any operations that trigger chemical perception should
be avoided after <b>meshmol</b> is used, such as using the ball-and-stick 
or sphere <a href="../representation.html">representations</a>
or <a href="addh.html">adding hydrogens</a>, even to other molecules.
Atoms and bonds use more memory than surface points and mesh lines, 
and rendering large surfaces as cylinders may take a long time.  
Mesh molecules with more than 100,000 atoms cannot be
<a href="../savemodel.html#pdb">saved as PDB files</a> because the CONECT
records only allow 5-digit atom serial numbers.
