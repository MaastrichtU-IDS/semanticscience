<h3><a href="usageconventions.html">Usage</a>:
 <BR><b>addh</b> <a href="#options"><i>options</i></a></h3> 
<p>
<b>Addh</b> adds hydrogens to molecules, as well as
OXT atoms where missing from peptide C-termini.
It is the command-line implementation of
<a href="../../ContributedSoftware/addh/addh.html"><b>AddH</b></a>.
Chimera uses atom and residue names, or if these are not "standard,"
atomic coordinates, to determine connectivity and
<a href="../idatm.html">atom types</a>;
the atom types are then used to determine the number of hydrogens
to be added and their positions.
The positions of pre-existing atoms are not changed, but
any lone pairs and unidentifiable-element atoms are deleted.
</p><p>
If any atoms cannot be assigned a 
<a href="../idatm.html">type</a>, a dialog will appear.
It is necessary to click on the line for each unassigned
atom and then indicate its
proper substituent geometry and number of substituents.
</p><p>
Added hydrogens are colored the 
<a href="../colortables.html#byelement">element color</a> (default white)
if the attached atom is colored by element, otherwise the same as 
the attached atom.

See the <a href="../../ContributedSoftware/addh/addh.html"><b>AddH</b></a>
manual page for details including
<a href="../../ContributedSoftware/addh/addh.html#bondlengths">bond 
lengths</a> and

on radii</a>.

<h4>Options</h4>

Option keywords for <b>addh</b> can be truncated to unique strings
and their case does not matter.
A vertical bar "|" designates mutually exclusive options, and
default values are indicated with <b>bold</b>.
Synonyms for true: True, 1.  Synonyms for false: False, 0.

<blockquote>
  <tt><b>hbond</b> <b>true</b>|false</tt>
  <br>Hydrogens are placed based on the <a href="../idatm.html">types</a> 
  of the existing atoms and to avoid clashes;
  this option controls whether H-bond formation should also be considered.
  Considering H-bonds increases calculation time, and the method is
  still under development. Even when <b>hbond</b> is <b>true</b>,
  hydrogen positions are not energy-minimized, and
  a globally optimal network in terms of the number of H-bonds or 
  total H-bonding energy is not necessarily found.  
   Both intra- and inter-model hydrogen bonds are considered, including
  interactions with models to which hydrogens are not being added (as in 
  <a href="../../ContributedSoftware/findhbond/findhbond.html">
  <b>FindHBond</b></a> when the 
  <a href="../../ContributedSoftware/findhbond/findhbond.html#scope">scope</a>
  of the calculation is set to <b>both</b>).
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <tt><b>useHisName</b> <b>true</b>|false</tt>
  <br>Whether to use residue names for histidine to determine which 
  sidechain nitrogens should be protonated: the &delta;-nitrogen
  in residues named HID, the &epsilon;-nitrogen in HIE, and both 
  nitrogens in HIP.  Residues named HIS will be 
  treated as unspecified, and may end up with either or both sidechain 
  nitrogens protonated depending on the local environment and 
  whether H-bonds are being considered (whether <b>hbond</b> is <b>true</b>).
  If <b>useHisName</b> is <b>false</b>, 
  all histidine residues will be treated as unspecified regardless of 
  which of the above residue names are used.
  To specify interactively the protonation state of each histidine,
  use the <a href="../../ContributedSoftware/addh/addh.html"><b>AddH</b></a>
  graphical interface instead of the command <b>addh</b>.
  For other types of residues, <b>addh</b> attempts to achieve
  <a href="../../ContributedSoftware/addh/addh.html#states">protonation 
  states</a> reasonable at physiological pH.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <tt><b>spec</b>
  <a href="frameatom_spec.html" target="_top"><i>atom-spec</i></a></tt>
    <br>Whether to restrict hydrogen addition to a subset of
    the open molecule models.  Hydrogens will be added to the 
    entire model(s) containing the specified atoms.  If
    <a href="frameatom_spec.html" target="_top"><i>atom-spec</i></a>
    includes any spaces, it must be enclosed in single or double quote marks.
Regardless of whether they are specified for hydrogen addition, 
<b>other models in the vicinity will affect hydrogen placement</b>; 
if such interactions are not desired, the other models should be closed 
before hydrogens are added.
Different submodels of the same model will not affect each other, however.
