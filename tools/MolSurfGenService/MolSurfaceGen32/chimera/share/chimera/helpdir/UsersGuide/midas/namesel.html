<h3><a href="usageconventions.html">Usage</a>:
 <BR><b>namesel</b> [ <i>name</i> ]</h3>
<p>
<b>Namesel</b> names and saves the current 
<a href="../selection.html">selection</a>.  This can also be done with
<a href="../menu.html#namesel"><b>Select... Name Selection</b></a> in the menu.
The selection contents are remembered, not the process by which the 
selection was generated (<i>i.e.</i>, even if all oxygens in the current 
structures are selected, the named selection will not include oxygens
in <i>different</i> structures opened later).   
</p><p>
The <b>namesel</b> command without any arguments lists the names of all
saved selections in the 
<a href="../chimerawindow.html#statusline">status line</a> and
<a href="../reply.html"><b>Reply Log</b></a>.
