<h3><a href="usageconventions.html">Usage</a>:
 <BR><b>move</b> <i>axis</i> [ <i>distance</i> [ <i>frames</i> ]]
[ models <i>model-spec</i> ] 
[ coordinateSystem <i>N</i> ] 
</h3>
<p>
<b>Move</b> translates the specified <b>models</b> by <i>distance</i>
along the specified <i>axis</i> for a specified number of <i>frames</i>
(default <b>1</b>).  
If a <i>distance</i> is not given, the length of the <i>axis</i> vector
will be used.  If no models are specified, all 
<a href="../mouse.html#activedef">active</a> models will be translated.
</p><p>
A <b>coordinateSystem</b> for axis definition can be specified
by reference model number <i>N</i>, optionally preceded by #.
Otherwise, the laboratory frame of reference will be used, in which:
 <ul>
 <li>the X-axis is horizontal in the plane of the screen, 
  increasing to the right
 <li>the Y-axis is vertical in the plane of the screen, increasing upward
 <li>the Z-axis is perpendicular to the screen, increasing outward
  (toward the viewer)
 </ul>
The <i>axis</i> can be:
<ul>
<li><b>x</b> - unit vector along the X-axis (1,0,0)
<li><b>y</b> - unit vector along the Y-axis (0,1,0)
<li><b>z</b> - unit vector along the Z-axis (0,0,1)
<li><i>x,y,z</i> (three values separated by commas only) - an arbitrary vector 
</ul>
The <i>distance</i> is in the units of length intrinsic to the data,
usually &Aring;, and can be positive or negative.

Keyword options can be used in any order and the keywords can be truncated.

Examples:
<blockquote>
<b>move x -1 25 models #1,2</b
<br>
<b>move 5,2.5,0 coord #0 mod #0 30</b>
</blockquote>
Commands continue to be processed while the requested motion is in progress.
To prevent processing of further commands until the motion is finished, use the
<b><A href="wait.html">wait</A></b> command.
To halt an ongoing <b>move</b>, use <A href="freeze.html"><b>freeze</b></A>.
