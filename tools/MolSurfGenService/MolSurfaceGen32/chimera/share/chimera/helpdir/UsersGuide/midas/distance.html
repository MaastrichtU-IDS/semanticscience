 <BR><b>distance</b> [ signed ] <i>item1 item2</i></h3>

<p>
The <b>distance</b> command measures the distance between two items: 
<ul>
<li>two atoms
<li>two geometric objects created with 
<a href="define.html"><b>define</b></a> (or
<a href="../../ContributedSoftware/structuremeas/structuremeas.html#axes"><b>Axes/Planes</b></a>)
<li>one atom and one geometric object
</ul>
Any <a href="frameatom_spec.html" target="_top">atom specification</a>
that gives the proper number of atoms can be used.
For example, two atoms can be specified collectively with the word 
<b>selected</b>, <b>sel</b>, or <b>picked</b> if the current 
<a href="../selection.html">selection</a> contains only those two atoms.  
Objects are specified by ID as shown in the
<a href="../../ContributedSoftware/structuremeas/structuremeas.html#objectlist"><b>Axes/Planes</b> table</a>.
The distance is reported in the <a href="../reply.html"><b>Reply Log</b></a>.
</p><p>
Atom-atom distance measurements are <b><i>monitors</i></b>, meaning that a
<a href="../pbpanel.html#pbdef">pseudobond</a> is drawn between the
two atoms and the pseudobond's label will automatically update to reflect 
any changes in the distance.  Updates are not sent to the 
<a href="../reply.html"><b>Reply Log</b></a>, however.
Distance monitors are listed in the
<a href="../../ContributedSoftware/structuremeas/structuremeas.html#distances">
<b>Distances</b></a> tool.
Color and other aspects of pseudobond display can be controlled using the 
<b>distance monitor</b> <a href="../pbattrib.html">attributes panel</a>
(opened from the <a href="../pbpanel.html"><b>PseudoBond Panel</b></a> or
with the <b>Display options...</b> button on the
<a href="../../ContributedSoftware/structuremeas/structuremeas.html#distances">
<b>Distances</b></a> tool).
</p><p>
An individual distance monitor can be removed by using <b>~distance</b> with 
<a href="frameatom_spec.html" target="_top">specification</a> of the
two atoms involved.
Using <b>~distance</b> without any argument or with the keyword <b>all</b> 
removes all distance monitors.
</p><p>
Other types of distance measurements (atom-object and object-object) are simply
reported in the <a href="../chimerawindow.html#statusline">status line</a> 
in addition to the <a href="../reply.html"><b>Reply Log</b></a>. 
For distance measurements,
axes are treated as finite line segments, while planes are treated as infinite.
For atom-plane distances only, the <b>signed</b> keyword can be supplied to
indicate that distances on opposite sides of the plane should be reported
with opposite signs.
</p><p>
Examples:
<blockquote>
<b>distance :bgc@c1 a4</b>
</blockquote>
- measure the distance between atom C1 in residue BGC and axis a4
<blockquote>
<b>distance signed p2 :313.a@o</b>
</blockquote>
- measure the signed distance between plane p2 
and atom O in residue 313 of chain A
<blockquote>
<b>~distance #1:12@CA #0:47@CA</b>
</blockquote>
- stop monitoring the distance between atom CA of residue 12 in model 1 and 
atom CA of residue 47 in model 0
