<h3><a href="usageconventions.html">Usage</a>:
 <BR><b>fly</b>  [<i>master-frames</i>] &nbsp;<i>view1</i>&nbsp; 
[[&nbsp;<i>frames1_2</i>]&nbsp;<i>view2</i>]
[[&nbsp;<i>frames2_3</i>]&nbsp;<i>view3</i>] ... 
[[&nbsp;<i>framesN-1_N</i>]&nbsp;<i>viewN</i>] </h3>
<p>
<b>Fly</b> uses cubic interpolation to smoothly traverse a series of positions 
previously named and saved with <a href="savepos.html"><b>savepos</b></a>.
The command <b><A href="reset.html">reset</A></b> can also interpolate
between positions, but it only considers a pair of positions 
(start and end) at a time, whereas
<b>fly</b> can consider multiple positions and generate a path that 
visits and leaves intermediate positions without discontinuities in motion.
</p><p>
A position includes model transformations, scale, and
<a href="../clipping.html">clipping plane</a> positions.
Saved positions are included in saved
<a href="../sessions.html#sesdef">Chimera sessions</a>.
</p><p>
<b>Fly</b> starts abruptly at the first position, <i>view1</i>,
then proceeds through the list of subsequent positions.
The <i>master-frames</i> argument (default <b>1</b>) 
is how many frames each "leg" of the journey (from one position to the next)
should take, unless overridden by a frames argument specific to that leg.
<a name="examples">Examples</a>:
<blockquote><b>
fly p1 p2 p3
</b></blockquote>
- go from p1 to p2 in 1 frame and then to p3 in 1 frame
<blockquote><b>
fly 50 p1 p2 p3
</b></blockquote>
- go from p1 to p2 in 50 frames and then to p3 in 50 frames
<blockquote><b>
fly p1 10 p2 25 p3
</b></blockquote>
- go from p1 to p2 in 10 frames and then to p3 in 25 frames
<blockquote><b>
fly 40 p1 100 p2 p3
</b></blockquote>
- go from p1 to p2 in 100 frames and then to p3 in 40 frames
