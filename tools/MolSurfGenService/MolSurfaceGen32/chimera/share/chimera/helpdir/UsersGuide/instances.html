<h3>Instances of Tools</h3>
<p>
Instances of certain <a href="framecontrib.html" target="_top">tools</a>
and data tables are available from the <b>Tools</b> menu.
A previously started tool or previously generated data table may be
listed in the bottom section of the <b>Tools</b> menu:
<blockquote>
<b>Tools...  <i>Instance_name</i></b>
</blockquote>
where <b><i>Instance_name</i></b> includes the name of the tool or table
and sometimes the name of the data that it shows or manipulates.
There can be multiple instances of the same tool with the same data
or with different data.  A submenu for each instance contains the options:
<ul>
  <li><b>Raise</b> - show the interface
  <li><b>Hide</b> - hide the interface without exiting from the instance
  <li><b>Quit</b> - exit from this instance
</ul>
