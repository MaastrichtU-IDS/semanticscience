<h3><a href="usageconventions.html">Usage</a>:
 <BR><b>split</b> [ <i>model_number(s)</i> ]</h3>
<p>
The <b>split</b> command divides molecule models into separate
<a href="atom_spec.html#subcats">submodels</a>, one for each chain.
The <i>model_number(s)</i> argument can be one or more 
model numbers or ranges separated by commas and preceded by #.
If no models are specified, all molecule models will be affected.
Chain identifiers are not changed, and they are appended 
to the original model name to generate unique names for the submodels.
</p><p>
Placing chains in separate submodels allows for more independent control. 
For example, using the <a href="../modelpanel.html"><b>Model Panel</b></a>,
each can be activated/deactivated for motion or 
hidden/shown at the model level
(without changing atomic display settings) independent of the others.
</p><p>
There is no way to undo this operation except by reopening
the original structure.
