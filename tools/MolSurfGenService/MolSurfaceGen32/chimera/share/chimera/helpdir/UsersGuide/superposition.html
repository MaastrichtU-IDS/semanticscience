There are several ways to superimpose structures in Chimera:
<ul>
<li><a href="../ContributedSoftware/matchmaker/matchmaker.html"><b>MatchMaker</b></a> 
(or command <a href="midas/mmaker.html"><b>matchmaker</b></a>)
performs a fit after automatically identifying which residues should be paired.
Pairing uses both sequence and secondary structure,
allowing similar structures to be superimposed
even when their sequence similarity is low to undetectable.
</ul>
<blockquote>
The figure shows five distantly related proteins
(pairwise sequence identities &lt;&nbsp;25%) 
from the <a href="http://scop.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/scop/search.cgi?sunid=50978"
target="_blank">SCOP WD40 superfamily</a> before and after <a 
href="../ContributedSoftware/matchmaker/matchmaker.html"><b>MatchMaker</b></a> 
superposition with default parameters.
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Structures can be matched 
<a href="../ContributedSoftware/multalignviewer/multalignviewer.html#superposition">using 
a pre-existing sequence alignment</a> shown in
<a href="../ContributedSoftware/multalignviewer/framemav.html"
target="_top"><b>Multalign Viewer</b></a>.
<br><br>
<li>The exact atoms to pair can be specified with the
<a href="midas/match.html"><b>match</b></a> command.
This works on any type of structure, while the preceding methods 
apply only to peptide and nucleotide chains.
<br><br>
<li>Structures can be superimposed manually by
<a href="mouse.html#activedef">activating/deactivating</a> 
them for motion and <a href="mouse.html">using the mouse</a>.
</ul>
Except for manual matching, the methods allow iterative exclusion of
poorly superimposed atoms from the fit.

For the special case of an <b><i>ensemble</i></b>, which contains multiple
sets of coordinates for exactly the same atoms, see also
<a href="../ContributedSoftware/ensemblematch/ensemblematch.html"><b>Ensemble
Match</b></a>.
</p><p>
A multiple sequence alignment can be generated from a set of superimposed 
structures using
<a href="../ContributedSoftware/matchalign/matchalign.html"><b>Match 
-> Align</b></a>.

<h3>MatchMaker vs. Match</h3>
<p>
Usually
<a href="../ContributedSoftware/matchmaker/matchmaker.html"><b>MatchMaker</b></a> 
(or command <a href="midas/mmaker.html"><b>matchmaker</b></a>) provides the 
easier route to superimposing related proteins or nucleic acids.
Unlike <a href="midas/match.html"><b>match</b></a>,
it does not require the user to specify which atoms should be used.
On the other hand, it:
<ul>
<li>takes more time due to the sequence alignment step 
(determining residue pairing)
<li>offers less control over which atoms are used for fitting: always uses 
<a href="../ContributedSoftware/matchmaker/matchmaker.html#matchatom">one 
point per residue</a>
<li>recomputes protein secondary structure assignments;
this promotes consistency in assignments between structures and can improve
how they are superimposed, but the
<a href="midas/mmaker.html#computeSS">option to reassign 
secondary structure</a> should be turned off
if one would rather use the assignments in the input files
</ul>
Of course, <a href="midas/match.html"><b>match</b></a> would be the 
preferred method for superimposing sets of atoms representing
known local similarities within globally dissimilar structures 
such as proteins of different folds.
