<h2>Structure Analysis and Comparison Tutorial</h2>
<p>
This tutorial includes binding site analysis and comparison of related
structures by superposition and morphing.  Internet connectivity is required 
to fetch the structures <b>2zcp</b> and <b>2zco</b>.

The pathogenic organism <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> makes a
pigment called staphyloxanthin.  The pigment imparts a golden color 
(hence <i>aureus</i>), but more importantly, contributes to virulence 
by protecting the bacteria from killing by the host immune system.
The <i>S. aureus</i> enzyme CrtM may be a good drug target 
because it catalyzes a key step in staphyloxanthin synthesis:

Fetch a structure from the <a href="http://www.rcsb.org" 
target="_blank">Protein Data Bank</a> and use the ribbons 
<a href="../menu.html#menupresets">preset</a>:

This preset displays the two protein chains (A and B) as red and blue ribbons;
bound molecules and nearby sidechains are shown as sticks.
The two chains are two copies of the enzyme.  Delete chain B:
<blockquote>
<i>Command</i>:&nbsp;<b><a href="../midas/delete.html">delete</a>&nbsp;:.b</b>
<br>
<i>Command</i>:&nbsp;<b><a href="../midas/focus.html">focus</a></b>

<a href="../sideview.html#sideview"><b>Side View</b></a>.
</p><p>
The enzyme combines two 15-carbon molecules of farnesyl pyrophosphate
to form a 30-carbon lipid.  This structure contains 
farnesyl <b><i>thio</i></b>pyrophosphate, 
which differs from the substrate by having a sulfur in the place of one
oxygen.  Sulfur atoms are yellow, phosphorus orange, oxygen red, and
nitrogen blue.  Label the ligand residues:
<blockquote>
<i>Command</i>:&nbsp;<b><a href="../midas/rlabel.html">rlabel</a>&nbsp;ligand</b>
</blockquote>
In this structure, the farnesyl thiopyrophosphate molecules are named FPS and
are residues 657 and 658 of chain A.
Three metal ions help to offset the negative charges on the phosphates.
These are shown as greenish spheres; hovering the mouse cursor 
over each reveals (assuming default 
<a href="../preferences.html#General">balloon preferences</a>)
that they are Mg ions.
Metal coordination bonds from FPS, water, and the protein 
are shown with dashed purple lines.
Lines drawn to indicate interactions other than
covalent bonds are called <b><i>pseudobonds</i></b>.
Hovering the cursor over a pseudobond or bond shows balloon information 
about its end atoms and length.
</p><p>
Delete the water and label residues with displayed atoms:
<blockquote>
<i>Command</i>:&nbsp;<b><a href="../midas/delete.html">del</a>&nbsp;solvent</b>

Water could be included in the various analyses, 
but is removed here to simplify the tutorial.

<h3><a href="#top" class="nounder"><b>&larr;</b></a>
<a name="dists">Distances, H-Bonds, Contacts</a></h3>
<p>
It looks like several sidechains could be donating hydrogen bonds
to ligand phosphate oxygens.  (Although the structure does not include
hydrogens, we know they are there!)  
</p><p>
One of the displayed residues is Ser 21.  To measure a distance:
<ol>
<li>Ctrl-click to pick the sidechain oxygen of Ser 21
<li>Shift-Ctrl-doubleclick on the nearest phosphate oxygen
<li>click <b>Show Distance</b> in the resulting menu
</ol>
Similarly, measure the distance between the sidechain oxygen of Tyr 248
and the same phosphate oxygen. 
</p><p>
The distances seem consistent with hydrogen bonds.  
However, rather than measuring many distances and trying to remember the
appropriate hydrogen-bonding distances for different types of atoms,
just use <a href="../../ContributedSoftware/findhbond/findhbond.html">
<b>FindHBond</b></a>.  We will limit the search to H-bonds involving
the FPS residues:
<ol>
<li>Select the FPS residues (for example, with <b>Select... Residue... FPS</b>
in the menu).
<li>Start <a href="../../ContributedSoftware/findhbond/findhbond.html">
<b>FindHBond</b></a> by clicking its <a href="#toolicons">icon</a>.
<li>In that dialog, turn on the options:
  <ul>
  <li><b>Only find H-bonds with at least one end selected</b> 
  <li><b>Write information to reply log</b>
  </ul>
<li>Set <b>Line width</b> to 3. 
<li>Click <b>OK</b>.
</ol>
The H-bonds are shown as pseudobonds of the specified color and line width.
Both measured distances were found to be consistent with hydrogen bonding.
Details can be viewed in the <b>Reply Log</b>, which can be opened by
clicking its <a href="#toolicons">icon</a>.
(In your own work, you may prefer to write the information to a file instead.)
Remove the "hydrogen bond" pseudobonds:
<blockquote>
<i>Command</i>:&nbsp;<b><a href="../midas/hbonds.html">~hbond</a></b>
</blockquote>
<a href="../../ContributedSoftware/findclash/findclash.html"><b>Find
Clashes/Contacts</b></a> has some similarities to <b>FindHBond</b>,
but it can also identify nonpolar interactions:
<ul>
<li><b><i>clashes</b></i> 
- unfavorable interactions where atoms are too close together; close contacts
<li><b><i>contacts</b></i> 
- all kinds of direct interactions:
polar and nonpolar, favorable and unfavorable (including clashes)
</ul>
We will identify contacts of the FPS residues:
<ol>
<li>Start <a href="../../ContributedSoftware/findclash/findclash.html"><b>Find 
Clashes/Contacts</b></a> by clicking its <a href="#toolicons">icon</a>.
<li>With the FPS residues still selected, click <b>Designate</b>.
48 atoms should be designated for checking against <b>all other atoms</b>.
<li>Set the <b>Clash/Contact Parameters</b> to the default <b>contact</b> 
criteria (by clicking the button marked <b>contact</b>).
<li>Set the <b>Treatment of Clash/Contact Atoms</b> to:
 <ul>
 <li><b>Select</b> 
 <li><b>Write information to reply log</b>
 <li>(turn off any other treatment options)
 </ul>
<li>Click <b>Apply</b>.
</ol>
In the <b>Reply Log</b>, the atom-atom contacts are listed in order of
decreasing VDW overlap.
</p><p>
Even though all of the contacting atoms have been selected,
not all of them are displayed.  Click into the
graphics window, press the keyboard up arrow key to promote the selection
from atoms to whole residues, and then display the selection (<b>Actions...
Atoms/Bonds... show</b>). 
</p><p>
One might simply want a list of the interacting residues rather than 
the details of each atomic contact.  A list of the selected residues
can be saved.  First, deselect the ligand residues and ions, 
leaving the protein residues selected:
<blockquote>
<i>Command</i>:&nbsp;<b><a href="../midas/select.html#newer">~sel</a>&nbsp;ligand&nbsp;|&nbsp;ions</b>
</blockquote>
Open the <a href="../inspection.html"><b>Selection Inspector</b></a> 
by choosing <b>Actions... Inspect</b> from the menu or
by clicking the magnifying glass icon <img src="../inspecticon.png">
near the bottom right corner of the main window.
It reports that 26 residues are selected.
Click its <b>Write List...</b> button or
choose <b>Actions... Write List</b> from the main menu.
In the resulting dialog, indicate that <b>selected residues</b> 
should be written.  Click <b>Log</b> to write the list to the 
<b>Reply Log</b> instead of to a file.
</p>

<h3><a href="#top" class="nounder"><b>&larr;</b></a>
<a name="angles">Angles, Rotamers, Clashes</a></h3>
<p>
Amino acid torsion angle values can be viewed in the
<a href="../inspection.html"><b>Selection Inspector</b></a>.
Focus on Tyr 248:
<blockquote>
<i>Command</i>:&nbsp;<b><a href="../midas/focus.html">focus</a>&nbsp;:248</b>
</blockquote>
Ctrl-click to pick any atom or bond in Tyr 248.  
This will replace (clear) any pre-existing selection.
Open the <a href="../inspection.html"><b>Selection Inspector</b></a>
again if it is not already open.
Inspecting <b>Residue</b> (instead of <b>Atom</b>)
shows that the sidechain angles chi1 and chi2 in this residue 
are approximately &ndash;107&deg; and &ndash;142&deg;, respectively.
The phi and psi backbone angles are also given.
When multiple residues with different angle values are selected, 
the dialog will report ranges.
</p>
<table align="right" style="margin:8px 8px 8px 8px">
<tr><th align="center">
<a name="fig2">clash checking</a></th></tr>
<tr><td><img src="2zcp-clash.png"></td></tr>
</table>
<p>
We will set up clash checking and rotate the sidechain interactively.
<ol>
<li>Display additional residues within 4 &Aring; of Tyr 248:
<blockquote>
<i>Command</i>:&nbsp;<b><a href="../midas/display.html">disp</a>&nbsp;:248&nbsp;z<4</b>
</blockquote>
<li>Click into the main graphics window, then press the up arrow
key on the keyboard to promote the atom or bond selection 
within Tyr 248 to the whole residue.
<li>Start <a href="../../ContributedSoftware/findclash/findclash.html"><b>Find 
Clashes/Contacts</b></a> by clicking its <a href="#toolicons">icon</a>. 
<li>In that dialog, click <b>Designate</b>.
The 12 atoms of Tyr 248
should be designated for checking against <b>all other atoms</b>.
<li>Set the <b>Clash/Contact Parameters</b> to the default <b>clash</b> 
criteria (by clicking the button marked <b>clash</b>).
<li>Set the <b>Treatment of Clash/Contact
Atoms</b> to <b>Draw pseudobonds</b>; turn off any other treatment options. 
<li>Set the <b>Frequency of Checking</b> to <b>after relative motions</b>.
</ol>
No clashes are found in the current position. 
To rotate the sidechain of Tyr 248 interactively:
<ol>
<li>Ctrl-doubleclick its CA-CB bond (the stick segment right next to the ribbon)
<li>click <b>Rotate Bond</b> in the resulting menu
</ol>
The rotatable bond will be listed in the
<a href="../../ContributedSoftware/structuremeas/structuremeas.html#adjust">
<b>Adjust Torsions</b></a> dialog.  In that dialog, if you change the 
<b>Near</b> atom to <b>N</b>, the value reported is the chi1 angle.
There are several ways to rotate a bond, including dragging the pointer 
on the dial, clicking the black arrowheads, and
editing the angle value directly.  
</p><p>
Use whichever method you prefer to rotate the bond.
As the sidechain moves, yellow pseudobonds show any clashes and the
distance monitor updates automatically.
The sidechain is fairly constrained; only chi1 angles of approximately 
&ndash;(100-120)&deg; avoid clashes if only that bond is rotated.
The sidechain can be frozen in a new position, but for tutorial purposes,
simply restore it to its original position: in the <b>Adjust Torsions</b>
dialog, click the entry under <b>Bond</b> to show a menu. 
In that menu, choose <b>Revert</b> (move back to original position) 
and then <b>Deactivate</b> (make the bond no longer rotatable).
<b>Close</b> the torsion dialog.  
</p><p>
Click the <b>Find Clashes/Contacts</b> <a href="#toolicons">icon</a> to 
bring the dialog to the front and <b>Close</b> it to halt clash checking.
</p><p>
Next, we will compare the conformation of Tyr 248 in the structure
to tyrosine rotamers from a library.  This will indicate whether
the sidechain is in a frequently observed conformation
and whether other conformations might also fit into the structure.  
</p><p>
With part of Tyr 248 still selected (if not, Ctrl-click to
to select any of its atoms or bonds), start 
<a href="../../ContributedSoftware/rotamers/rotamers.html">
<b>Rotamers</b></a> by clicking its
<a href="#toolicons">icon</a>.  Click <b>OK</b> to show <b>TYR</b>
rotamers from the <a href="http://dunbrack.fccc.edu/bbdep/" 
target="_blank"><b>Dunbrack</b> backbone-dependent library</a>.
The rotamers are shown in the wire representation and listed in another dialog.
</p><p>
Clicking a line in the rotamer dialog displays just that rotamer.
Clicking the lines one by one shows that none of the rotamers
match the conformation in the structure.
</p><p>
The rotamer dialog reports chi1 and chi2 angles and probabilities
from the library based on the residue's backbone conformation.
Other than the backbone angles, 
the probabilities do not take into account any interactions
specific to this structure.  However, the rotamer dialog is integrated
with clash and H-bond detection.  Choose <b>Columns... Add... Clashes</b> 
and click <b>OK</b> to use the default settings; repeat with
<b>Columns... Add... H-Bonds</b>.
</p><p>
The new columns show that each
rotamer forms several clashes but no hydrogen bonds.  
We showed above that Tyr 248 H-bonds with the ligand and avoids clashes, 
which may compensate for its nonrotameric (presumably strained) conformation.
</p><p>
A sidechain can be replaced with a chosen rotamer.
With a single rotamer shown, either click <b>OK</b> in the rotamer dialog
to replace the sidechain with that rotamer and remove the others, 
or simply <b>Close</b> the dialog 
to remove the rotamers without replacing the sidechain.
Although not done in this case, rotamers can be shown for a 
different amino acid type than in the structure, allowing
for virtual mutations.  
</p><p>
Unlike Tyr 248, Tyr 41 closely resembles the highest-probability tyrosine
rotamer given its backbone angles.  If you like, focus on Tyr 41, 
select one of its atoms or bonds, 
and use <a href="../../ContributedSoftware/rotamers/rotamers.html">
<b>Rotamers</b></a> to show and evaluate rotamers of tyrosine 
or some other amino acid at that position.
</p><p>
Remove the distance pseudobonds, unlabel the residues, clear the selection,
and zoom back out:
</p>

<h3><a href="#top" class="nounder"><b>&larr;</b></a>
<a name="surfaces">Surfaces and Attributes</a></h3>
<p>
FPS and the natural substrate both have a highly polar/charged "head"
and a long hydrocarbon tail.  The enzyme pocket is very large and deep,
as needed to accommodate two of these molecules.  
</p><p>
A surface representation is best for showing the shape of the pocket.  
First, choose <b>Favorites... Preferences</b> from the menu,
change to <b>Category</b>: <a href="../preferences.html#New Surfaces"><b>New 
Surfaces</b></a>, and set <b>show disjoint
surfaces</b> to <b>false</b>.  This will make the surface simpler by
ignoring small enclosed pockets inside the protein.
<b>Close</b> the preferences.
</p>
<table align="left" style="margin:8px 8px 8px 8px">
<tr><th align="center">
<a name="fig3">2zcp pocket surface</a></th></tr>
<tr><td><img src="2zcp-pocketsurf.png"></td></tr>
</table>
<p>
Choose <b>Presets... Interactive 3 (hydrophobicity surface)</b> from the menu 
to display a molecular surface color-coded by amino acid hydrophobicity.
This <a href="../menu.html#menupresets">preset</a> colors the surface
ranging from dodger blue for the most polar residues to white
to orange red for the most hydrophobic residues.  
</p><p>
As one might expect, the mouth of the pocket near the phosphates and ions is 
mostly polar, while the rest of the pocket is largely hydrophobic.  
However, the pocket is so deep that it is hard to see when the whole surface 
is shown.  Restricting the surface display to the pocket region allows it 
to be viewed from the outside, as shown in the <a href="#fig3">figure</a>.
</p><p>
Hide the surface, the ribbon, and the protein atoms:
<blockquote>
<i>Command</i>:&nbsp;<b><a href="../midas/surface.html">~surf</a></b>
<br>
<i>Command</i>:&nbsp;<b><a href="../midas/ribbon.html">~ribbon</a></b>
<br>
<i>Command</i>:&nbsp;<b><a href="../midas/display.html">~disp</a> protein</b>
</blockquote>
Surface display can be limited to a zone in a couple of different ways:
<ul>
<li>Command-line <a href="../midas/atom_spec.html#zones">zone specifications</a>
use atom-atom distances.  For example, the following displays the surface
patches of protein atoms within 6.5 &Aring; of ligand atoms:
<blockquote>
<i>Command</i>:&nbsp;<b><a href="../midas/surface.html">surf</a>&nbsp;protein&nbsp;&&nbsp;ligand&nbsp;za<6.5</b>
</blockquote>
A fairly large cutoff is needed to avoid holes in the pocket surface.
Apparently, this pocket includes some "wiggle room."
<br><br>
<li>The second way is with
<a href="../../ContributedSoftware/surfzone/surfzone.html"><b>Surface 
Zone</b></a>.  Display the whole surface and 
<a href="../selection.html">select</a> the atoms of interest, for example:
<blockquote>
<i>Command</i>:&nbsp;<b><a href="../midas/surface.html">surf</a> protein</b>
<br>
<i>Command</i>:&nbsp;<b><a href="../midas/select.html#newer">sel</a> ligand</b>
</blockquote>
Start <a href="../../ContributedSoftware/surfzone/surfzone.html"><b>Surface 
Zone</b></a> (under <b>Tools... Surface/Binding Analysis</b>) and click
the <b>Zone</b> button.
This tool measures distances to surface vertices, and it
allows the cutoff to be adjusted interactively with a slider.
The <a href="#fig3">figure</a> shows results for a cutoff of 4.7 &Aring;.
If you use this method, clear the selection afterward by 
Ctrl-clicking in an empty area of the graphics window.
</ul>
Amino acid hydrophobicity is one example of an <b><i>attribute</i></b>.
Another attribute commonly used in structure analysis is atomic
B-factor.  B-factor values indicate which parts of the structure
are more or less flexible or disordered.  Display all atoms by choosing
<b>Presets... Interactive 2 (all atoms)</b> from the menu.   
</p><p>
The <a href="../../ContributedSoftware/render/render.html#render"><b>Render
by Attribute</b></a> tool shows attribute values with colors 
and other visual cues.  Choose <b>Tools... Depiction...
Render by Attribute</b> from the menu to start this tool.
The dialog is set to <b>atoms</b> when it appears.  Choose
<b>bfactor</b> from the attribute menu.  The B-factor values are shown in a
histogram, and the vertical bars on the histogram define a color mapping.
These bars or <b><i>thresholds</i></b> can be added, deleted,
moved, and/or their colors changed.  Clicking the square
<a href="../coloring.html#colorwell">color well</a> allows changing
the color of the threshold that was most recently clicked or moved.
If any sidechain was replaced with a rotamer, the new atoms will not have 
B-factor values, but they can be assigned a <b>No-value color</b>.
Adjust the color mapping as desired, then <b>Apply</b> it to the structure.
The lowest B-factors are in the protein core, the highest in a loop over
the active site and the C-terminus on the opposite side.
</p><p>
In the <b>Render</b> dialog, switch from <b>atoms</b> to
<b>residues</b> and show the histogram for the attribute
<b>kdHydrophobicity</b>, the
<a href="../midas/hydrophob.html">Kyte-Doolittle hydrophobicity</a>.  
This is the same attribute used by the surface preset, 
but this tool allows different color schemes to be applied.
Higher numbers correspond to more hydrophobic (less polar) amino acids.
The <b>No-value color</b> pertains to residues without Kyte-Doolittle
hydrophobicity values, namely any that are not amino acids.
<b>Apply</b> coloring by hydrophobicity if you like, 
then <b>Close</b> the dialog.
</p>

<h3><a href="#top" class="nounder"><b>&larr;</b></a>
<a name="comparison">Superposition and Morphing</a></h3>
<p>
Comparing different structures of a protein is another way to evaluate
flexibility.  We have been viewing a structure bound to substrate analogs,
<b>2zcp</b>.  A structure of the same enzyme without ligands is also available.
</p><p>
Fetch the "empty" structure and apply the ribbons preset:
<blockquote>
<i>Command</i>:&nbsp;<b><a href="../midas/open.html">open</a>&nbsp;2zco</b>
<br>
<i>Command</i>:&nbsp;<b><a href="../midas/preset.html">preset</a>&nbsp;apply&nbsp;int&nbsp;1</b>
</blockquote>
Now the first structure is white and the new structure is magenta, as shown in 
the <a href="../modelpanel.html"><b>Model Panel</b></a> 
(<b>Tools... General Controls... Model Panel</b>).  
</p><p>
The structures are in completely different positions, 
so the next step is to superimpose them.  This is easily accomplished with
<a href="../../ContributedSoftware/matchmaker/matchmaker.html"><b>MatchMaker</b></a>
or its <a href="../midas/mmaker.html">command equivalent</a>:
<blockquote>
<i>Command</i>:&nbsp;<b><a href="../midas/mmaker.html">mm</a>&nbsp;#0&nbsp;#1</b>
</blockquote>
<b>MatchMaker</b> generates a sequence alignment using residue types and 
secondary structure (tries to align helix with helix and strand with strand)
and then fits CA-CA pairs in the same columns of the sequence alignment.
By default, it iterates the fit so that far-apart pairs are not 
included in the final match.  Match statistics are reported in the <b>Reply
Log</b>.  The sequence alignment is not shown by default, but can be displayed
by adding <b>show true</b> to the above command.
</p><p>
Alternatively, the following produces exactly the same superposition:
<blockquote>
<i>Command</i>:&nbsp;<b><a href="../midas/match.html">match</a>&nbsp;iterate&nbsp;2.0&nbsp;#1@ca&nbsp;#0@ca</b>
</blockquote>
<table align="right" style="margin:8px 8px 8px 8px">
<tr><th align="center">
<a name="fig4">different loop conformations</a></th></tr>
<tr><td><img src="2zcp-loopdiff.png"></td></tr>
</table>
This command works because the structures have equal numbers of CA atoms, and
the first CA atom in one structure correctly pairs with the first in the 
other, the second with the second, and so on.
The <a href="../midas/match.html"><b>match</b></a> command does not generate
a sequence alignment, so it is faster than <b>MatchMaker</b>.  
Another potential advantage is that it can use any atoms, not just CA.  
Its main disadvantage is that in most cases, 
one must figure out and specify which residues 
in one structure should pair with which residues in the other.
While not used by default, iteration can be turned on, as shown above.
</p><p>
Either way, iteration is recommended so that similar parts will superimpose
well and dissimilar parts will stand out better.  These two structures are
very similar except for the loop at approximately residues 51-56
(you can see residue numbers by hovering the cursor over the ribbon):
<blockquote>
<i>Command</i>:&nbsp;<b><a href="../midas/display.html">disp</a>&nbsp;:51-56</b>
</blockquote>
Morphing involves calculating a series of intermediate, interpolated
structures between the original input structures.  In Chimera, the
series of structures is treated as a trajectory that can be replayed,
saved to a coordinate file, or saved as a movie using
<a href="../../ContributedSoftware/movie/framemovie.html"
target="_top"><b>MD Movie</b></a>.
</p><p>
Start the <a href="../../ContributedSoftware/morph/morph.html">morphing
tool</a>:
<blockquote>
<i>Command</i>:&nbsp;<b><a href="../midas/start.html">start</a>&nbsp;Morph&nbsp;Conformations</b>
</blockquote>
Click <b>Add...</b> and in the resulting list of models, doubleclick
to choose #0, #1, and #0 again, corresponding to a morph trajectory from the 
ligand-bound structure to the empty structure and back.
<b>Close</b> the model list.
In the main <b>Morph Conformations</b> dialog, set the <b>Action on Create</b>
to <b>hide Conformations</b>, and then click <b>Create</b>.
</p><p>
The progress of the calculation is reported in the
<a href="../chimerawindow.html#statusline">status line</a>.  
When all the intermediate structures have been calculated, the input 
structures are hidden, the trajectory is opened as a third model (#2), and the
<a href="../../ContributedSoftware/movie/framemovie.html"
target="_top"><b>MD Movie</b></a>
tool appears.  The trajectory can be played continuously or one step
at a time by clicking buttons on the tool, 
or a frame number can be entered directly.
</p><p>
The initial display style of the trajectory and which atoms are shown/hidden
mimic the input structures, but in fact all atoms that are present in both
input structures are also present in the trajectory.  The coloring and
display can be controlled just as in any other structure.
For example, to show only aromatic amino acids along with the ribbon:
<blockquote>
<i>Command</i>:&nbsp;<b><a href="../midas/show.html">show</a>&nbsp;#2&nbsp;&&nbsp;aromatic</b>
</blockquote>
Ligand residues were only present in one of the structures, so they are
not included in the morph trajectory.  
However, part or all of the original structures can be displayed 
along with the trajectory.  Display of the other models can be re-enabled by
checking the <b>S</b>(hown) boxes in the
<a href="../modelpanel.html"><b>Model Panel</b></a> (<b>Tools... 
General Controls... Model Panel</b>) or with a command, for example:
<blockquote>
<i>Command</i>:&nbsp;<b><a href="../midas/modeldisplay.html">modeldisp</a>&nbsp;#0</b>
</blockquote>
Then, to show only the ligand residues in that model:
<blockquote>
<i>Command</i>:&nbsp;<b><a href="../midas/ribbon.html">~ribbon</a>&nbsp;#0</b>
<br>
<i>Command</i>:&nbsp;<b><a href="../midas/display.html">~disp</a>&nbsp;#0</b>
<br>
<i>Command</i>:&nbsp;<b><a href="../midas/display.html">disp</a>&nbsp;:fps</b>
</blockquote>
In this case, the secondary structure does not change much between the input 
structures. When conformational differences are larger and ribbons
will be displayed, one may want to re-evaluate the secondary structure 
at each step of the trajectory.  That can be done by putting the command
<a href="../midas/ksdssp.html"><b>ksdssp</b></a> in a
<a href="../../ContributedSoftware/movie/movie.html#per-frame">per-frame
Chimera script</a> in
<a href="../../ContributedSoftware/movie/framemovie.html"
target="_top"><b>MD Movie</b></a>.
</p><p>
The <a href="../../ContributedSoftware/morph/morph.html"><b>Morph 
Conformations</b></a> page lists a few additional
<a href="../../ContributedSoftware/morph/morph.html#examples">example
systems</a>.

When finished enjoying the morph trajectory,
choose <b>File... Quit</b> from the menu to exit from Chimera.
