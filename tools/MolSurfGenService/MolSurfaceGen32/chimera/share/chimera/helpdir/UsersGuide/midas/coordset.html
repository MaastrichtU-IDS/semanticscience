<h3><a href="usageconventions.html">Usage</a>:
<BR><b>coordset</b> <i>model-spec</i> <i>frame</i>
[ holdSteady <a href="frameatom_spec.html" 
target="_top"><i>atom-spec</i></a> ]</h3>
<h3><a href="usageconventions.html">Usage</a>:
<BR><b>coordset</b> <i>model-spec</i> [<i>start</i>],[<i>end</i>][,<i>step</i>]
[ holdSteady <a href="frameatom_spec.html" 
target="_top"><i>atom-spec</i></a> ]</h3>
<p>
<b>Coordset</b> plays through frames of a trajectory previously 
loaded into Chimera.  Users should be aware of significant limitations:
<ul>
<li>Depending on the format, fully loading a trajectory may require
using the <a href="../../ContributedSoftware/movie/framemovie.html"
target="_top"><b>MD Movie</b></a> graphical interface to play every frame
beforehand (not just to read the input and show the first frame).  This
initial playthrough is not required, however, for trajectories 
read from PDB files or created by <a href="morph.html">morphing</a>.
<li>The <b>coordset</b> command and
<a href="../../ContributedSoftware/movie/framemovie.html" 
target="_top"><b>MD Movie</b></a> graphical interface are not integrated:
for example, frame updates with the command will not be reflected 
in the graphical interface, and hold-steady and scripting operations
using the graphical interface will be ignored by the command.
</ul>
<i>Model-spec</i> is the model number of the trajectory, preceded by #.
Atoms to hold as steady as possible upon frame updates can be
<a href="frameatom_spec.html" target="_top">specified</a>
using the <b>holdSteady</b> keyword. 
</p><p>
Supplying only one <i>frame</i> number without commas indicates simply
going to that frame.  A positive number is taken literally, whereas a 
negative number <i>N</i> is interpreted as the <i>N</i>th-to-last frame.
<pre>
Examples:

<b>coordset #0 10</b>
  (go to frame 10 of trajectory model #0)
<b>coordset #0 -10</b>
  (go to the 10th-to-last frame)
</pre>
Supplying comma-separated frame numbers or even commas without preceding
numbers indicates playing from <i>start</i> (default is the current frame) 
to <i>end</i> (default is the last frame) in increments of <i>step</i>.
The default <i>step</i> is <b>1</b> if <i>start</i> &lt; <i>end</i>,
<b>&ndash;1</b> if <i>start</i> &gt; <i>end</i>, determined after 
any negative frame numbers are converted to the corresponding 
actual frame numbers.
<pre>
Examples:

<b>coordset #0 1,21 holdSteady @ca</b>
  (play from frame 1 to 21 of trajectory model #0, holding CA atoms steady)
<b>coordset #0 1,</b>
  (play from frame 1 to the end)
<b>coordset #0 ,15</b>
  (play from the current frame to 15)
<b>coordset #0 ,,5</b>
  (play from the current frame to the end, every 5th frame)
<b>coordset #0 21,1</b>
  (play from frame 21 to 1, backwards)
<b>coordset #0 -1,1,-10</b>
  (play from the last frame to the first, every 10th frame, backwards)
