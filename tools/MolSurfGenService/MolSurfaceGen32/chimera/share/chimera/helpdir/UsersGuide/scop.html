<title>SCOP Domain Files</title>
</head><body>
<h2>SCOP Domain Files</h2>
<p>
Protein domain structures are categorized hierarchically
in the <a href="http://scop.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/scop/index.html" target="_blank">
Structural Classification of Proteins </a> (SCOP) database.
Given a SCOP domain identifier, Chimera will try to retrieve the 
domain coordinate file from the 
<a href="http://astral.berkeley.edu/index.html" target="_blank">
ASTRAL Compendium</a>.  This input type can be indicated
in the <a href="fetch.html"><b>Fetch by ID</b></a> dialog
or by specifying the file as <b>scop:<i>sid</i></b>,
where <b><i>sid</i></b> is the SCOP domain identifier.
</p><p>
The 7-character
<b><i>sid</i></b> consists of "d" + the 4-character PDB ID of the
file of origin + the PDB chain ID ("_" if none, "." if multiple) +
a single-digit integer if needed to specify the domain uniquely ("_"
if not).  Examples:  
<ul>
<li>d2dria_
<li>d1jpdx1
</ul>
For further details and examples, see the 
<a href="http://scop.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/scop/release-notes.html#scop-parseable-files"
target="_blank">SCOP release notes</a>
(<b><i>sid</i></b> is the "old scop identifier").
</p><p>
The SCOP domain files are in PDB format, but are distinguished from other
PDB files by how they are specified and from where they are obtained.
