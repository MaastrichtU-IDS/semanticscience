<h3>MS and DMS Files</h3></a>
<p>
MS and DMS files contain dot molecular surfaces in the format
output by the programs <i>ms</i> (written by Michael Connolly)
and <a href="midas/dms1.html"><i>dms</i></a> (a reimplementation
<a href="http://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/Overview/software.html#dms"
target="_blank">available</a>
from the UCSF Computer Graphics Lab).
This <a href="midas/dms1.html#dmsformat">format</a> is referred to
as "DMS" below.  Such files can also be created with the Chimera tool 
<a href="#writedms"><b>Write DMS</b></a>.
</p><p>
DMS files can be used as input to
<a href="http://dock.compbio.ucsf.edu/DOCK_6/dock6_manual.htm#Sphgen"
target="_blank"><i>sphgen</i></a>, part of the
<a href="http://dock.compbio.ucsf.edu/index.html" target="_blank">DOCK</a>
suite of programs.  
</p><p>
In Chimera, there are
<a href="filetypes.html">several ways</a> to open DMS files.  File type is
indicated with a suffix (<b>.ms</b> or <b>.dms</b>, part of the filename)
or a prefix (<b>ms:</b> or <b>dms:</b>, not part of the filename).  
</p><p>
Although DMS files contain solvent-excluded molecular surfaces,
they are read into Chimera as VRML models that will not update to reflect
changes in any corresponding atoms.
Only a single color, set when the file is opened, is used.
However, a DMS surface can be associated with a 
particular molecule model so that the two cannot be moved 
or <a href="mouse.html#activedef">activated/deactivated</a> 
for motion independently.
</p><p>
Surface-related Chimera menu items and the command
<a href="midas/surface.html"><b>surface</b></a> only apply to
<a href="representation.html#surfaces">MSMS surfaces</a>,
not VRML surfaces.
</p>

<h3><a name="writedms">Write DMS</a> <img src="writedmsicon.png"></h3>
<p>
<b>Write DMS</b> saves part or all of a
<a href="representation.html#surfaces">molecular surface</a> 
(MSMS model) in Chimera as a <a href="#dmsfile">DMS file</a>.
</p><p>
Parameters that affect molecular surface geometry 
can be adjusted before writing the DMS file.
Since Chimera's surface calculation method differs from that in the program
<a href="midas/dms1.html"><i>dms</i></a>, the dots will not coincide exactly,
but various parameters can be adjusted to make the results 
as similar as possible:
<ul>
<li><b>probe radius</b> - the
<a href="midas/dms1.html"><i>dms</i></a> default and Chimera
default are both 1.4 &Aring;.  If a different value had been
used with <a href="midas/dms1.html"><i>dms</i></a>, the Chimera setting
can be changed analogously.  Probe radius for an existing surface can be
changed in the
<a href="msmsattrib.html">MSMS attributes panel</a>, or by
<a href="selection.html#pickselect">selecting</a> the surface and using
<a href="inspection.html"><b>Selection Inspector</b></a>. The probe
radius to use for subsequently created surfaces can be set in the
<a href="preferences.html#New Surfaces"><b>New Surfaces</b> preferences</a>.
<li><b>vertex density</b> - the
<a href="midas/dms1.html"><i>dms</i></a> default of 1.0 gives 
~5 points/&Aring;<sup>2</sup> whereas the Chimera default is 
2.0 points/&Aring;<sup>2</sup>.  Vertex density in Chimera can be adjusted
as described above for probe radius.
<li><b>atomic radii</b> - <a href="midas/vdwrad.html">Chimera default radii</a> 
differ from the <a href="midas/radii"><i>dms</i> default radii</a>.  There may
not be a reason to prefer one set over the other, but if desired, the
radii in Chimera can be changed to the <i>dms</i> default values by using
<a href="../ContributedSoftware/defineattrib/defineattrib.html"><b>Define
Attribute</b></a> to read the assignment file
<a href="dmsrad.txt" type="text/plain">dmsrad.txt</a>.
</ul>
There are <a href="extension.html">several ways to start</a>
<b>Write DMS</b>, a tool in the <b>Structure Editing</b> category.
</p><p>
The <a href="representation.html#surfaces">MSMS surface</a> 
of interest should be chosen from the pulldown list.
Options:
<ul>
<li><b>Save normals</b> - include normal vectors 
(required by 
<a href="http://dock.compbio.ucsf.edu/DOCK_6/dock6_manual.htm#Sphgen"
target="_blank"><i>sphgen</i></a>)
<li><b>Limit output to displayed surface sections</b>
- only write surface vertices that are displayed,
which could include vertices that are invisible due to 
<a href="clipping.html">clipping</a> or
<a href="../ContributedSoftware/surfzone/surfzone.html">zoning</a>,
or that simply fall outside the current view.  
Display of per-atom surface patches can be controlled with the
<a href="midas/surface.html"><b>surface</b></a> command or with the
<a href="menu.html#actsurface"><b>Actions... Surface</b></a> menu.
</ul>
<b>Save</b> writes a file using the specified name and location and
dismisses the dialog, while <b>Close</b> simply dismisses the dialog.
<b>Help</b> opens this manual page in a browser window.
