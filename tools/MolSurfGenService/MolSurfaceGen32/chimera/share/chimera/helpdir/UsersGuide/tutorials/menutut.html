<h2>Getting Started Tutorial - Menu Version</h2>
<p>
Many tasks in Chimera can be accomplished in multiple ways.
For example, colors and <a href="../representation.html">
display styles</a> can be changed with
the <a href="../menu.html#menuactions"><b>Actions</b> menu</a>
or by entering <a href="../framecommand.html" target="_top">commands</a>.
In general, commands are much more concise and powerful, but menus
allow easy access to features without requiring
knowledge of commands and their syntax.
</p><p>
In this tutorial, many of the same tasks performed with commands in
the <a href="getting_started.html"><b>Getting Started Tutorial -
Command Version</b></a> are carried out using the menus instead.
</p><p>
<a name="downloadfiles">
To follow along,</a>
first <a href="download.html">download</a>
the PDB files included with this tutorial
to a convenient location on your computer:
<ul>
<li><a href="1zik.pdb">1zik.pdb</a> - leucine zipper
<li><a href="1d86.pdb">1d86.pdb</a> - DNA and netropsin
</ul>
</p>
<hr>
<a name="part1">
<h3>Menus, Part 1 - Manipulation, Selection, and Chains</h3></a>
<p>
On <b>Windows</b>/<b>Mac</b>, click the <b>chimera</b> icon;
on <b>UNIX</b>, start Chimera from the system prompt:
<blockquote><tt>
<i>unix</i>: <b>chimera</b>
</tt></blockquote>
A splash screen will appear, to be replaced in a few seconds
by the main Chimera window.  If you like, resize the Chimera window
by dragging its lower right corner.
</p><p>
Now open a structure.  Choose <b>File... Open</b> from the menu
and use the resulting <a href="../opensave.html#opendialog">file browser</a>
to locate and open the <a href="#downloadfiles">previously downloaded</a>
file 1zik.pdb (the <b>File type</b> should be set to
<b>all (guess type)</b> or <b>PDB</b>).
The structure is a leucine zipper formed by two peptides.
</p><p>
A <a href="../menu.html#menupresets">preset</a>
is a predefined combination of display settings.
Apply interactive preset #2, which displays all atoms and colors the
heteroatoms by element:
<blockquote>
<b>Presets... Interactive 2 (all atoms)</b>
</blockquote>
</p>
<table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" 
align="right" style="margin:8px 8px 8px 8px">
<tr><td><img src="sideview.png"></td></tr>
</table>
<p>
Use the <b>Favorites</b> menu to show the
<a href="../sideview.html#sideview"><b>Side View</b></a>.
Each window or tool can be moved to a convenient location
by clicking its top bar and dragging.
</p><p>
The <a href="../sideview.html#sideview"><b>Side View</b></a> allows
interactive scaling (zooming) and clipping.  
It shows a tiny version of the structure.  Within the <b>Side View</b>,
try moving the eye position (the small square)
and the clipping planes (vertical lines)
with the left mouse button.  The
<b>Side View</b> will renormalize itself after movements, so that
the eye or clipping plane positions may appear to "bounce back,"
but your adjustments have been applied.
</p><p>
Try <a href="../mouse.html">moving the structure with the mouse</a>
in the main graphics window.  By default, the left
mouse button controls rotation and the middle mouse button controls XY
translation.  Continue moving and scaling
the structure with the mouse in the graphics window
and <b>Side View</b> as desired throughout the tutorial.
</p><p>
Hovering the mouse cursor over an atom or bond (without clicking any buttons)
will show identifying information in a pop-up "balloon."
The balloon will disappear when the cursor is moved away.
</p><p>
In Chimera, <b><i>selection</i></b> specifies atoms, bonds,
residues, <i>etc.</i> for subsequent operations
with the <a href="menu.html#menuactions"><b>Actions</b> menu</a>.
Ways to make a <a href="../selection.html">selection</a> include using the 
<a href="../menu.html#menuselect"><b>Select</b> menu</a> or
<a href="../selection.html#pickselect">picking</a> from the screen.
The <a href="../menu.html#menuactions"><b>Actions</b> menu</a>
applies to whatever is selected, but when nothing is selected, the
<a href="../menu.html#menuactions"><b>Actions</b> menu</a>
applies to everything.
</p><p>
Hide the water (red dots):
<blockquote>
<b>Select... Structure... solvent</b><br>
<b>Actions... Atoms/Bonds... hide</b>
</blockquote>
Alternatively, the water could have been selected using
<b>Select... Residue... HOH</b>.  Even though the water is hidden,
it is still selected.
</p><p>
Clear the selection and display only the chain trace:
<blockquote>
<b>Select... Clear Selection</b><br>
<b>Actions... Atoms/Bonds... backbone only... chain trace</b>
</blockquote>
The chain trace includes just the &alpha;-carbons (atoms named CA),
connected in the same way that the residues are connected.
</p><p>
By default,
<a href="../selection.html#pickselect">picking</a> from the screen
is done by clicking on the atom or bond of interest with the left
mouse button while holding down the <b>Ctrl key</b>.
To add to an existing selection, also hold down the <b>Shift key</b>.
Try picking two atoms, one from each peptide (Ctrl-click the
first, Ctrl-Shift-click the second).
The selection is highlighted in green, and its contents are reported on the
button near the lower right corner of the main window.
</p><p>
Label the atoms you have selected, first by atom name and then
by residue name and number:
<table align="right" style="margin:8px 8px 8px 8px">
<tr><th align="center">
<a name="reslab">residue labels</a></th></tr>
<tr><td><img src="reslab.png"></td></tr>
</table>
<blockquote>
<b>Actions... Label... name</b><br>
<b>Actions... Label... off</b><br>
<b>Actions... Label... residue... name + specifier</b>
</blockquote>
Each residue label is of the form:
<blockquote><tt>
<b><i>res_name res_number.chain</i></b>
</tt></blockquote>
One peptide is chain A and the other is chain B.
Clear the selection and undisplay the residue labels:
<blockquote>
<b>Select... Clear Selection</b><br>
<b>Actions... Label... residue... off</b>
</blockquote>
(Another way to clear a selection is to Ctrl-click in empty space.)
Color the two chains different colors:   
<blockquote>
<b>Select... Chain... A</b>
<br><b>Actions... Color... cyan</b>
</blockquote>
Repeat the process to color chain B yellow.
</p><p>
Select chain A by
<a href="../selection.html#pickselect">picking</a>
any atom or bond in the chain, then hitting the up arrow key twice,
once to <a href="../selection.html#expandselect">expand the selection</a>
to the entire residue and another time to expand it to the entire chain.
Display its full backbone:
<blockquote>
<b>Actions... Atoms/Bonds... backbone only... full</b>
</blockquote>
Display all atoms of chain A only (which is still selected):
<blockquote>
<b>Actions... Atoms/Bonds... show only</b>
</blockquote>
</p>
<table align="right">
<tr><th align="center">
<a name="byelement">coloring by element</a></th></tr>
<tr><td><img src="byelement.png"></td></tr>
</table>
<p>
Display all atoms and color them by element:
<blockquote>
<b>Select... Clear Selection</b><br>
<b>Actions... Atoms/Bonds... show</b><br>
<b>Actions... Color... by element</b>
</blockquote>
The <b>by element</b> coloring applies to all elements including carbon (gray),
whereas <b>by heteroatom</b> coloring (as in the preset used near the beginning
of the tutorial) leaves carbons unchanged.
Heteroatom-only coloring is especially useful for keeping multiple structures
with different default colors distinguishable.
</p><p>
Generally, each file of coordinates opened in Chimera becomes a model
with an associated model ID number.
Models are assigned successive numbers starting with 0.   
Models are listed in the left side of the
<a href="../modelpanel.html"><b>Model Panel</b></a>
(<b>Tools... General Controls... Model Panel</b>).
A checkbox in the <b>A</b>(ctive) column of the <b>Model Panel</b>
shows that the model is
<a href="../mouse.html#activedef">activated for motion</a>;
unchecking the box makes it impossible to move the model.
Checking the box again restores the movable state.
Make sure <b>1zik.pdb</b> is highlighted
on the left side of the <b>Model Panel</b> (if not, click on it)
and then click <b>close</b> in the list of functions on the right side.
Next, use the <b>Close</b> button at the bottom to close the <b>Model Panel</b>.
</p><p>
Go on to <b>Part 2</b> below, <b>OR</b> exit from Chimera with
<b>File... Quit</b>.
</p>

<h3>Menus, Part 2 - Molecular Representations and Surfaces</h3></a>
<p>
With Chimera started and the
<a href="../sideview.html#sideview"><b>Side View</b></a>
opened as described at the beginning of
<a href="#part1"><b>Part 1</b></a>, choose the menu item
<b>File... Open</b>.  Use the resulting
<a href="../opensave.html#opendialog">file browser</a>
to locate and open the <a href="#downloadfiles">previously downloaded</a>
file 1d86.pdb (the <b>File type</b> should be set to
<b>all (guess type)</b> or <b>PDB</b>).
It contains the molecule netropsin bound to double-helical DNA.
</p><p>
Use the "all atoms" preset, which will show the DNA as wire and
netropsin as spheres:
<blockquote>
<b>Presets... Interactive 2 (all atoms)</b>
</blockquote>
Undisplay the water:
<blockquote>
<b>Select... Structure... solvent</b><br>
<b>Actions... Atoms/Bonds... hide</b>
</blockquote>
Remember that hiding atoms does not deselect them; they remain
selected until the selection is cleared or replaced with a new selection.
</p>
<table align="right" style="margin:8px 8px 8px 8px">
<tr><td><img src="fourcolors.png"></td></tr>
</table>
<p>
Color the different nucleotides different colors.  For example,
color the adenine deoxynucleotides blue:
<blockquote>
<b>Select... Residue... DA</b>
<br><b>Actions... Color... blue</b>
</blockquote>
Analogously, color
cytosine deoxynucleotides (DC residues) cyan,
guanine deoxynucleotides (DG residues) yellow, and
thymine deoxynucleotides (DT residues) magenta.
Clear the selection with <b>Select... Clear Selection</b> or
by <a href="../selection.html#pickselect">picking</a> in empty space.
</p><p>
Rotate, translate, and scale the structure as needed to get a better look
(see <a href="../mouse.html">mouse manipulation</a> to review how
this is done).  Continue moving and scaling the structure
as desired throughout the tutorial.
</p><p>
Next, try some different <a href="../representation.html">display styles</a>, 
or representations.  Multiple styles can be combined with each other and with 
surfaces (more on surfaces below).
<table align="right" style="margin:8px 8px 8px 8px">
<tr><td><img src="ribbon.png"></td></tr>
</table>
<blockquote>
 <b>Actions... Ribbon... show</b>
 <br><b>Actions... Ribbon... edged</b>
 <br><b>Actions... Ribbon... rounded</b>
 <br><b>Actions... Ribbon... hide</b>
 <br><b>Actions... Atoms/Bonds... stick</b>
 <br><b>Actions... Atoms/Bonds... sphere</b>
</blockquote>
Change the representation of only one of the DNA strands:
<blockquote>
 <b>Select... Chain... A</b>
 <br><b>Actions... Atoms/Bonds... stick</b>
 <br><b>Select... Clear Selection</b>
</blockquote>
Next, change everything to a ball-and-stick representation:
<blockquote>
 <b>Actions... Atoms/Bonds... ball & stick</b>
</blockquote>
Ctrl-click to <a href="../selection.html#pickselect">pick</a>
one of the atoms in netropsin.	Label the residue,
<blockquote>
<b>Actions... Label... residue... name</b>
</blockquote>
showing that it is named NT.
The residue label might not be near the selected atom.
The first submenu under <b>Label</b> controls individual
atom labels, while the second controls residue labels.
<b>Actions... Label... name</b> would have shown the name of the atom
instead of the name of the residue.
</p><p>
Clear the selection (for example, with Ctrl-click in empty space)
and undisplay the residue label:
<blockquote>
 <b>Actions... Label... residue... off</b>
</blockquote>
<table align="right" style="margin:8px 8px 8px 8px">
<tr><td><img src="surfmain.png"></td></tr>
</table>
</p><p>
Finally, have some fun with surfaces.  There are
<a href="../midas/surface.html#surfcats">built-in categories</a>
within structures such as <b>main</b> and <b>ligand</b>;
when nothing is <a href="../selection.html">selected</a>,
<b>Actions... Surface... show</b> displays the surface of <b>main</b>.
<blockquote>
 <b>Actions... Surface... show</b>
 <br><b>Actions... Surface... hide</b>
 <br><b>Select... Structure... ligand</b>
 <br><b>Actions... Surface... show</b>
 <br><b>Actions... Surface... mesh</b>
</blockquote>
Surface color can be specified separately from
the colors of the underlying atoms.  
Change the surface color only of netropsin (which is still selected):
<blockquote>
 <ol>
 <li>change the coloring target:  <b>Actions... Color... surfaces</b>
 <li><b>Actions... Color... red</b>
 <li>restore the default coloring target:
 <b>Actions... Color... all of the above</b>
 </ol>
</blockquote>
Clear the selection, change back to a solid surface,
and then undisplay the surface.
<blockquote>
 <b>Select... Clear Selection</b>
 <br><b>Actions... Surface... solid</b>
 <br><b>Actions... Surface... hide</b>
</blockquote>
<table align="right" style="margin:8px 8px 8px 8px">
<tr><td><img src="surfpart.png"></td></tr>
</table>
As an example of a more complicated selection process, show the surface
of the adenine and thymine deoxynucleotides in chain B only:
<blockquote>
 <ol>
 <li>change the selection mode:  <b>Select... Selection Mode... append</b>
 <li><b>Select... Residue... DA</b>
 <li><b>Select... Residue... DT</b>
 <li>change the selection mode:  <b>Select... Selection Mode... intersect</b>
 <li><b>Select... Chain... B</b>
 <li><b>Actions... Surface... show</b>
 </ol>
</blockquote>
To prepare for any subsequent operations, restore the selection mode
and clear the selection:
 <blockquote>
 <b>Select... Selection Mode... replace</b>
 <br><b>Select... Clear Selection</b>
</blockquote>
The <a href="../framecommand.html" target="_top">command</a> equivalent
is much more concise, but requires some knowledge
of the <a href="../midas/frameatom_spec.html" target="_top">atom
specification syntax</a>:
<blockquote>
<i>Command</i>: <b><a href="../midas/surface.html">surf</a> :da.b,dt.b</b>
</blockquote>
</p><p>
Sometimes it is helpful to make a solid surface transparent:
 <blockquote>
 <b>Actions... Surface... transparency... 50%</b>
 </blockquote>
Choose <b>File... Quit</b> from the menu to terminate the Chimera session.
