<h3><a href="usageconventions.html">Usage</a>:
 <br>( <b>surfcolor</b> | <b>surfcolour</b> )
<i>source</i> <i>model_number(s)</i></h3>
<p>
The command <b>surfcolor</b> does not color surfaces.
Commands that color surfaces include
<b><A href="color.html">color</A></b>,
<b><A href="scolor.html">scolor</A></b>,
<b><A href="rangecolor.html">rangecolor</A></b>, and
<b><A href="rainbow.html">rainbow</A></b>.
</p><p>
Instead, <b>surfcolor</b> sets the coloring source
(effectively the level at which coloring is defined)
of a <a href="../representation.html#surfaces">molecular surface</a>, where
<i>source</i> can be <b>byatom</b> or <b>bymodel</b>.
The color of the surface does not necessarily
match the color of the items at the same level, since at each level
the "self" and surface color assignments may differ (see
<a href="../hierarchy.html">coloring hierarchy</a>).
If no <i>model_number</i> is supplied, all open models will be affected.
The <i>model_number(s)</i> should be preceded by #, as in a normal
<a href="atom_spec.html#basic">atom specification</a>.
</p><p>
For surface color to be visibly controlled
by the command <a href="color.html"><b>color</b></a>,
the surface color source must be atoms.  
Surface color source can also be set in the
<a href="../msmsattrib.html">molecular surface attributes panel</a>.
The source is normally atoms unless changed specifically or as
a side effect of custom coloring (for example, using
<b><A href="scolor.html">scolor</A></b>).
