<h3><a href="usageconventions.html">Usage</a>:
 <BR><b>crystalcontacts</b> <i>model_number</i> <i>distance</i>
[ copies true|false ] [ replace true|false ]</h3>
<p>
The <b>crystalcontacts</b> command checks for clashes 
between copies of a structure when they are positioned 
according to symmetry information in the header of the PDB file.  
It is the command-line implementation of
<a href="../../ContributedSoftware/crystalcontacts/crystalcontacts.html">
<b>Crystal Contacts</b></a>. 
</p><p>
The structure must have been opened from a PDB file containing
symmetry information; otherwise, there is no reason to use this command.  
The <i>model_number</i> (preceded by #) specifies the structure,
and <i>distance</i> specifies what will be considered a close contact.
</p><p>
The results are shown schematically.
Each copy of the original structure is shown as a ball, and close contacts 
between copies are shown as cylinders connecting the balls:
  <ul>
  <li> <b>green balls</b> = the original structure and 
  copies related by noncrystallographic symmetry
  <li> <b>blue balls</b> = copies related by crystallographic symmetry, 
   together with the green balls representing one unit cell
  <li> <b>yellow balls</b> = copies from neighboring unit cells
  <li> <b>red cylinders</b> = close contacts
  </ul>
See <a href="../../ContributedSoftware/crystalcontacts/crystalcontacts.html">
<b>Crystal Contacts</b></a> for details.
</p><p>
The <b>copies</b> keyword (default <b>false</b>) indicates whether to
load the full atomic coordinates of any contacting copies.  The keyword
<b>replace</b> (default <b>true</b>) indicates whether to replace any
pre-existing schematic representation from <b>crystalcontacts</b>
with the new one rather than generating an additional model.
Synonyms for true: True, 1.  Synonyms for false: False, 0.
