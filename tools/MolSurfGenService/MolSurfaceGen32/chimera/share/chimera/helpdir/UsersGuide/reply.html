from Chimera.  Error messages are in red and warnings are in blue italics.
When <a href="../ContributedSoftware/idle/idle.html"><b>IDLE</b></a> 
is open, however, messages are sent there instead of to the <b>Reply Log</b>.
See also the <a href="preferences.html#Messages"><b>Messages</b>

The log can be searched for a string of interest, and the
<b>Forward</b> and <b>Back</b> buttons can be used to navigate
between multiple occurrences of the string.

<b>Close</b> dismisses the <b>Reply Log</b>, and <b>Help</b> opens
