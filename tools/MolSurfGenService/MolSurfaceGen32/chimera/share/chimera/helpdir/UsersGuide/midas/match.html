<h3><a href="usageconventions.html">Usage</a>:
 <BR><b>match</b> [ iterate <i>cutoff</i> ] 
[ showMatrix true|false ] [ move true|false ] [ active ]
<a href="atom_spec.html#basic"><i>atom-spec1</i></a>
<a href="atom_spec.html#basic"><i>atom-spec2</i></a></h3>
<p>
The <b>match</b> command uses least-squares fitting to superimpose
two models.  <a href="atom_spec.html#basic"><i>Atom-spec1</i></a> and
<a href="atom_spec.html#basic"><i>atom-spec2</i></a>
should contain equal numbers of atoms from two different models, respectively.
The atoms need not be connected.
Atoms are paired according to the order in which they are specified,
<i>i.e.</i>, the first atom of the first model is matched to the first atom
of the second model, the second atom to the second atom, and so on.
The first model will be transformed so that its atoms overlay those of the
second model.  At least three pairs of atoms are needed to define a unique
transformation, although fewer pairs can be used.
</p><p>
If atom order is not specified, for example,
<blockquote>
<b>match #1:fad #0:fad</b>
<!-- example structures 1f3p and 1lvl -->
<br>
<b>match #2:246,295 #0:195,221</b>
<!-- example structures 4enl #2 and 2mnr #0 -->
</blockquote>
the atoms within a residue are ordered first by name,
and where these are identical, by alternate location identifier, and where
these are also identical, by serial number.
</p><p>
All of the atoms (from both models) can be specified collectively
using the word <b>selected</b>, <b>sel</b>, or <b>picked</b> if the
current <a href="../selection.html">selection</a> contains
equal numbers of atoms from each model.  The atoms should have
been <a href="../selection.html">selected</a>
(most likely <a href="../selection.html#pickselect">picked</a>)
in the proper order, first the desired atoms from one model,
then the corresponding atoms in the corresponding order from the other model.
When order information is lacking
(for example, the atoms were selected simultaneously),
the match may not be the one intended.
</p><p>
The <b>iterate</b> keyword indicates that successive rounds of 
matching should be performed. In each cycle, atom pairs 
are removed from the match list and the remaining
pairs are fitted, until no matched pair is
more than <i>cutoff</i> angstroms apart.
The atom pairs removed are either the 10% farthest apart of all pairs
or the 50% farthest apart of all pairs exceeding the cutoff, whichever
is the lesser number of pairs.
This excludes conformationally dissimilar regions from the final fit
and allows the best-matching regions to be well superimposed.
</p><p>
The final root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of just the paired atoms
is reported in the 
<a href="../chimerawindow.html#statusline">status line</a> and
<a href="../reply.html"><b>Reply Log</b></a>.
The <b>showMatrix</b> option (synonym <b>show</b>, default <b>false</b>) 
indicates whether the transformation matrix should also be reported
in the <a href="../reply.html"><b>Reply Log</b></a>.
The related command <a href="rmsd.html"><b>rmsd</b></a> calculates an
RMSD of atoms in their current positions, without any fitting.
</p><p>
The <b>move</b> option (default <b>true</b>) indicates 
whether the transformation should be performed.  
If false, the first model will not be moved to overlay the second, 
but the reported RMSD and matrix values will still reflect what would have
been obtained if the transformation had taken place.
</p><p>
If the <b>active</b> keyword is given, not only the first model will be
transformed, but also any other models that are
<a href="../mouse.html#activedef">activated for motion</a>
(except the second, reference model),
using the same transformation that was applied to the first.
