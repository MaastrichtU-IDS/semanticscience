<title>Select Sequence</title>
</head><body>
<h2>Select Sequence</h2>
<p>
Choosing <a href="menu.html#selectseq"><b>Select... Sequence</b></a>
opens an interface for selecting residues by entering a specific sequence
or pattern of amino acids or nucleotides.
To instead display an entire sequence and select segments within it with
the mouse, use the 
<a href="../ContributedSoftware/multalignviewer/framemav.html"
target="_top"><b>Sequence</b></a> tool.
</p><p>
The sequence selection dialog has two sections arranged as index cards; 
clicking the tab for a card brings it to the front.
<ul>
<li>
The <b>Subsequence</b> section allows the sequence to be specified
as a string of one-letter codes.  Case is not important.
<b>Ambiguity codes</b> may be used:
<ul>
<li><b>none</b> - only allow exact matches of one-letter codes
<li><b>protein</b> - in addition to exact one-letter code matching,
allow B to match aspartic acid (D) and asparagine (N)
and Z to match glutamic acid (E) and glutamine (Q)
<li><b>nucleic acid</b> - in addition to exact one-letter code matching,
allow R to match the standard purine nucleotides (A, G), Y to match the
standard pyrimidine nucleotides (C, T, U), and N to match any of the five
(A, C, G, T, U)
</ul>
<br>
<li>
The <b>PROSITE pattern</b> section allows the sequence to be specified with
<a href="http://us.expasy.org/tools/scanprosite/scanprosite-doc.html#patsyntax"
target="_blank">PROSITE pattern syntax</a>.  Residue codes must be
capitalized; extended syntax involving an asterisk,
<i>e.g.</i> <b><{C}*></b>, is not supported.
</ul>
Note that occurrences in all sequence types (protein, DNA, and RNA) 
will be considered matches unless the option to 
<b>Force interpretation...</b> as protein or nucleic acid sequence is on.
When the option is on, only sequences of the indicated type
will be examined for matches.
