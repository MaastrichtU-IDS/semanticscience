<p>
<b>Reset</b> restores models to a default position or one 
previously saved with <a href="savepos.html"><b>savepos</b></a>.
A <i>view_name</i> is specified when a position is saved.
If <i>view_name</i> is missing, the name <b>default</b> is used.
</p><p>
A position includes:
<ul>
<li> the transformations of models
(their rotations and translations relative to input coordinates)
<li> the overall scale
<li> <a href="../clipping.html">clipping plane</a>
status, locations, and orientations
<li> the <a href="../sideview.html#rotation">center of rotation method</a>
</ul>
Unless changed with <a href="savepos.html"><b>savepos</b></a>,
the <b>default</b> position is one in which the models have not been rotated
or translated.
</p><p>
Saved positions are included in saved 
<a href="../sessions.html#sesdef">Chimera sessions</a>.
When a session is saved, the current position is automatically saved
with the <i>view_name</i> <b>session-start</b>.
</p><p>
<b>Reset</b> restores the named position over the specified number
of image update <i>frames</i> (default 1).  For <i>frames</i> &gt; 1,
an interpolation <i>method</i> (default <b>linear</b>) 
is used to generate a path from the current position to the named position.  
Currently, interpolation does not work with the <b>default</b> position,
and the only <i>method</i> available is <b>linear</b>.
Whereas <b>reset</b> interpolation considers only a pair of positions
at a time (start and end), the related command 
<a href="fly.html"><b>fly</b></a> can generate a smooth interpolated
path over a series of multiple saved positions.
</p><p>
The <b>list</b> keyword indicates that
the names of all saved positions should be listed in the
<a href="../chimerawindow.html#statusline">status line</a> and
<a href="../reply.html"><b>Reply Log</b></a>.
</p><p>
Models may have been closed or opened since the position was saved.
How these situations are handled:
<ul>
<li>If a model that was included in a saved position is no longer present 
when the position is restored, everything else will still be restored.  
<li>If some new model has been opened and assigned the same ID number 
as a model that was closed, the new model (but not any
<a href="../../ContributedSoftware/per-model/per-model.html">per-model
clipping plane</a>) will be treated as if it 
were the one included in the saved position.
<li>Otherwise, new models will be transformed to maintain their 
positions relative to the lowest-numbered old model.
</ul>
