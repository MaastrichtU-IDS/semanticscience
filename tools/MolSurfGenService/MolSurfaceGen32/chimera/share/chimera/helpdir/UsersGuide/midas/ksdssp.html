<h3><a href="usageconventions.html">Usage</a>:

<p>
<b>Ksdssp</b> is an implementation of the <b>K</b>absch and <b>S</b>ander
algorithm for <b>d</b>efining the <b>s</b>econdary <b>s</b>tructure of
<b>p</b>roteins, as described in:
<blockquote>
  W. Kabsch and C. Sander, "Dictionary of Protein Secondary
  Structure: Pattern Recognition of Hydrogen-Bonded and Geometrical
  Features" <i>Biopolymers</i> <b>22</b>:2577 (1983).
</blockquote>
Many, but not all, input structure files include protein secondary structure 
information.  In <a href="../tutorials/framepdbintro.html" 
target="_top">PDB format</a>, secondary structure assignments are described in
<a href="../tutorials/pdbintro.html#secondary">HELIX and SHEET records</a>.
When a peptide or protein structure file
that does not include secondary structure assignments is read,
<b>ksdssp</b> is <b><i>automatically</i></b>
invoked to generate helix and sheet information.
<b>Ksdssp</b> is also called automatically when
<b><A href="../../ContributedSoftware/matchmaker/matchmaker.html">
MatchMaker</A></b> is used with the 
<b>Compute secondary structure assignments</b> option,
regardless of whether secondary structure assignments already exist.
</p><p>
In Chimera, helix and sheet assignments are stored as true/false settings
(for each amino acid residue)
of the <a href="atom_spec.html#resprops">residue attributes</a>
<b>isHelix</b> and <b>isStrand</b> (<b>isSheet</b>).
The assignments are used for drawing protein
<a href="../representation.html#ribbon">ribbons</a> 
and may be used by
<b><A href="../../ContributedSoftware/matchmaker/matchmaker.html">
MatchMaker</A></b>, depending on its settings.
</p><p>
Parameter settings used are reported
in the <a href="../reply.html"><b>Reply Log</b></a>.  
Defaults to be used when <b>ksdssp</b> is called automatically can be changed
with the <a href="../modelpanel.html#computess"><b>compute SS</b></a> dialog 
(opened from the <a href="../modelpanel.html"><b>Model Panel</b></a>).
Defaults for the <b>ksdssp</b> <i>command</i>, however, cannot be changed
and are given <a href="#options">below</a>.
Different values can be specified with the command-line
<a href="#options">options</a>.
</p><p>
<b>Ksdssp</b> uses the coordinates of the backbone atoms
(N, CA, C, O, and optionally H) of a protein to determine
which residues are in helices and beta strands.  If an amide
hydrogen is missing, it is placed 1.01 angstroms from N along the bisector
of (1) the vector opposite the bisector of C-N-CA, and (2) the vector
opposite the C-O vector from the previous amino acid.
</p><p>
The calculation is applied to the models containing
<a href="frameatom_spec.html" target="_top"><i>atom-spec</i></a>,
and a blank <a href="frameatom_spec.html" target="_top"><i>atom-spec</i></a>
is interpreted as "all."
Models that do not appear to contain amino acids
(that is, nonpeptide molecules and nonmolecular objects) are ignored.
</p><p>
<b>Known problem</b>: reassigning secondary structure sets the
<a href="../../ContributedSoftware/ribbonstyle/ribbonstyle.html#scaling">ribbon
scaling</a> of some residues to <b>Chimera default</b>; any other scalings
previously in effect need to be reapplied (for example, with
<a href="ribscale.html"><b>ribscale</b></a>).
</p>

<h4><a name="options">Options</a></h4>
<blockquote>
  <tt><b>-c</b> <i>cutoff</i></tt>
    <br><b>Ksdssp</b> estimates the energy of each candidate
    hydrogen-bonding interaction and classifies it as a hydrogen bond
    if the energy is no greater than (at least as favorable as)
    <i>cutoff</i>.  The default is <b>&ndash;0.5</b> kcal/mol, as recommended
    by Kabsch and Sander, who add that "A good H-bond has about -3
    kcal/mol binding energy."
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <tt><b>-h</b> <i>helix_min</i></tt>
    <br>Helices must be at least
    <i>helix_min</i> residues long; the default is <b>3</b>.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <tt><b>-s</b> <i>strand_min</i></tt>
    <br>Beta strands must be at least
    <i>strand_min</i> residues long; the default is <b>3</b>.
    Reducing <i>strand_min</i> to 1 is not recommended,
    as there are bridges in many structures that confuse the
    algorithm for defining sheets.
</blockquote>
<p>
In most cases, the default parameter values
are reasonable for computing secondary structure.
