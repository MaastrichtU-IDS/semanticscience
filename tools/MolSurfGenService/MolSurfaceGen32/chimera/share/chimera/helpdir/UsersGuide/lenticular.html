<h2>Lenticular Images</h2>

<p>
<a name="lenticular">
A <b><i>lenticular image</i></b> is a combination of multiple input images
overlaid with a lensing material to provide a sense of depth, movement, or 
other change (depending on how the input images differ).</a>
The lensing material is a sheet of plastic molded into many tiny prisms.
The <a href="print.html"><b>Save Image</b></a> panel in Chimera includes a 
<b>lenticular</b> <a href="print.html#imagemode">image camera mode</a> 
for saving a set of images that differ slightly in viewing orientation.
Such a set can be used to make a lenticular image with apparent depth,
a <b><i>3D image</i></b>.

<h3>Prerequisites</h3></a>
<p>
Making a <a href="#lenticular">lenticular image</a> as described 
<a href="#instructions">below</a> requires the following:
<ul>
<li> software to generate the input images, in this case Chimera
<li> software to interlace the input images into one image 
  <ul>
  <li>several programs exist, varying in cost, performance, 
  and platform availability
  <li>a trial version from
  <a href="http://www.promagic.net/products.html" target="_blank">ProMagic</a> 
  worked well in tests with Chimera
  (available for Windows, requires PhotoShop<sup>&reg;</sup>)
  </ul>
<li> a printer, preferably high resolution
<li> lensing material with optical adhesive already applied,
such as from <a href="http://www.microlens.com/" 
target="_blank">microlens.com</a>
  <ul>
  <li>the appropriate material should be
  <a href="http://www.microlens.com/pages/choosing_right_lens.htm" 
  target="_blank">chosen</a> 
  based on the intended image type (in this case 3D), image size, 
  viewing distance, and other parameters
  </ul>
<li> a cold laminator to eliminate air bubbles between the printed image
and the lensing material
</ul>

<h3>Instructions</h3></a>

The following instructions are for making 
<a href="#lenticular">lenticular images</a> "by hand."
To produce very large images or a large number of copies,
you would more likely work with a commercial printer.
<ol>
<li>Find out your printer's resolution in DPI (dots per inch).
  <blockquote>
  For example, the UCSF Computer Graphics Lab (CGL) has an Epson printer 
  with 720 DPI.
  </blockquote>

<li>Note the 
<a href="http://www.microlens.com/pages/choosing_right_lens.htm" 
target="_blank">chosen</a> 
lensing material's LPI (lenses per inch).  For best results, perform a
<a href="http://www.microlens.com/pages/pitch_test.htm" 
target="_blank">pitch test</a>
to determine the <a name="effective"><i>effective</i></a> LPI
of the lens for your specific printer.
  <blockquote>
  The CGL has lenticular sheets in the portrait orientation with 60 LPI.
  These lenses were designed for 3D images and a viewing distance of
  1&ndash;5 feet.
  </blockquote>

<li>Prepare the scene in Chimera, avoiding the use of thin lines,
especially vertical or near-vertical.  Use <a href="stereo.html">stereo</a>
to see how much parallax is present.  Overly strong parallax makes it hard 
for the eyes to fuse the two views together.  One rule of thumb is to limit 
how much objects protrude in front of (or recede behind) the focal plane 
to approximately a third of the window width.
The relationship of the objects to the focal plane and the window width 
can be viewed and adjusted in the <a href="topview.html"><b>Top
View</b></a>.  You may wish to save your setup as a
<a href="sessions.html">Chimera session</a>.

<a href="print.html#tips">tips on preparing images</a>
<br><br>
<li>Generate the input image files.  DPI/LPI gives the 
number of files that should be generated (use the original LPI,
not the pitch-test-corrected value).
  <blockquote>
  With CGL's Epson printer and the lenticular sheets
  described above, 720/60 = 12 images. 
  </blockquote>
In Chimera's <a href="print.html"><b>Save Image</b></a> panel:
  <ul>
  <li> Set the <a href="print.html#imagemode"><b>Image camera mode</b></a> 
  (near the bottom)
  to <b>lenticular</b> and indicate the number of images to save.
  <li> Turn on <a href="print.html#imagesize"><b>Use print units</b></a>
  and set the image height and width to match the lens sheet
  (but make the image slightly smaller as needed
  to account for any alignment marks added by the interlacing software).
  <li> Set the desired <b>Print resolution (dpi)</b>.
  <li> Click <b>Save As...</b> to compute the images.
  <li> When the save dialog appears, set the <b>File type</b> 
  to an image format that can be read by your interlacing software.
  </ul>
<br><br>
<li>Use the software to interlace the input images into one image.
 (We used software from 
  <a href="http://www.promagic.net/products.html" 
  target="_blank">ProMagic</a>,
  but the procedure should be generally similar with other packages.)
  <ul>
  <li>Make sure the input images are in the left-to-right order
  (Chimera numbers the images in left-to-right order from 001 to N).
  <li>Doublecheck the image size, <a href="#effective">effective</a>  LPI,
  and type of interlacing (<i>i.e.</i>, this is not a flip).
  <li>If the interlacer can save the output as a 
  PhotoShop<sup>&reg;</sup> file (*.psd), use that option.
  </ul>
<br><br>
<li>Print the interlaced image. 
  <ul>
  <li>If the interlaced image lacks a color profile, assign it as 
  Adobe RGB when you open it in PhotoShop<sup>&reg;</sup>.  
  It may be necessary to alter the type
  of color correction done by the printer for a better match.
  <li>Make sure the image is printed at the specified size and resolution,
  as any scaling will destroy the lenticular effect.
  <li>The paper should be fed through the printer perpendicular to the 
  lens orientation, because printers are more accurate and have
  a higher resolution in the dimension in which the print head moves 
  (as opposed to the direction in which the paper moves).
  </ul>
<br><br>
<li>Use a cold laminator to
<a href="http://www.microlens.com/pages/mounting_a_lenticular_image.htm" 
target="_blank">mount the image</a>.  Air bubbles should be eliminated;
the trick is to go slow and only expose the adhesive a little at a time.
Hand tools for applying wallpaper might work well enough.  
A hot laminator should not be used because it might melt the lensing
material.
