<h2>Tools</h2>
<p>
See the <a href="framecontrib.html" target="_top">Tools</a> section of the
<a href="index.html" target="_top"><b>Chimera User's Guide</b></a> for
a listing of tools (extensions) and their individual manual pages.
</p><p>
There are several ways to start a tool:
<ul>
<li> by choosing its name from the
<a href="menu.html#menutools"><b>Tools</b> menu</a> 

<li> by specifying its name with the command
<a href="midas/start.html"><b>start</b></a> 

<li> by choosing its name from the
<a href="menu.html#menufavorites"><b>Favorites</b> menu</a> 
(if it has been listed there, using the
<a href="preferences.html#Tools"><b>Tools</b> preferences</a>)

<li> by clicking its icon in the
<a href="chimerawindow.html#toolbar">toolbar</a>
(if the icon has been placed there, using the
<a href="preferences.html#Tools"><b>Tools</b> preferences</a>)

<li> by specifying <a href="options.html#start"><b>--start</b>
<i>toolname</i></a> when <a href="startup.html">starting Chimera</a>
from the system command line

<li>automatically upon <a href="startup.html">Chimera startup</a>
(if previously set to do so, using the 
<a href="preferences.html#Tools"><b>Tools</b> preferences</a>)

<li>by opening a file whose <a href="filetypes.html">type</a> is
<a href="filetypes.html#associated">specific to the tool</a>
  </ul>
</ul>
Some tools can also be started by choosing the corresponding
<a href="modelpanel.html#functions">function</a> from the
<a href="modelpanel.html"><b>Model Panel</b></a> or by using
an <a href="../ContributedSoftware/accelerators/alist.html">accelerator</a>.
Depending on the tool,
something may happen right away, or dialog boxes requesting
input files or parameter settings may appear.
</p><p>
<a href="instances.html">Instances</a> of certain tools 
that have been started or data tables that have been generated 
during a Chimera session are available from the <b>Tools</b> menu,
allowing them to be raised, hidden, or quit.  For example, if the
<a href="chimerawindow.html#emulator"><b>Command Line</b></a>
has been started, it can be hidden by choosing
<b>Tools... Command Line... Hide</b>; if a
<a href="../ContributedSoftware/multalignviewer/framemav.html"
target="_top"><b>Multalign Viewer</b></a> window displaying
the alignment file apoex.fa becomes obscured by other windows, it can be
raised with <b>Tools... MAV - apoex.fa... Raise</b>.
