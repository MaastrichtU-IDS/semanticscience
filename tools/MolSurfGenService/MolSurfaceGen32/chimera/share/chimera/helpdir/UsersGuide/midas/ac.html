<h3><a href="usageconventions.html">Usage</a>:
<BR><b>ac</b> [<i>shortcut-list</i>]</h3>
<p>
Accelerators are simple 
<a href="../../ContributedSoftware/accelerators/alist.html">keyboard 
shortcuts</a> for many operations in Chimera.
<ul>
<li>Without arguments, the command <b>ac</b> simply enables use of
<a href="../../ContributedSoftware/accelerators/alist.html">accelerators</a>.
Accelerators are disabled by default.
<li>Given a <i>shortcut-list</i> of one or more
<a href="../../ContributedSoftware/accelerators/alist.html">accelerators</a>
separated by spaces, <b>ac</b> executes them in the order given 
without changing the pre-existing mode
(without changing whether or not accelerators are enabled).
This effectively converts the accelerators to commands, 
allowing them to be easily interspersed with other commands and included in
<a href="../indexcommand.html#cmdfile">command files</a>.
</ul>
See the <a href="../../ContributedSoftware/accelerators/accelerators.html">
<b>Keyboard Shortcuts</b></a> page for an explanation of
<a href="../../ContributedSoftware/accelerators/accelerators.html#conflict">
how keystrokes are interpreted</a> when accelerators are enabled
at the same time the
<a href="../chimerawindow.html#emulator"><b>Command Line</b></a> is shown.
</p><p>
Accelerators can be disabled with the accelerator <b>af</b> or the 
accelerator <b>cl</b> (which also shows the 
<a href="../chimerawindow.html#emulator"><b>Command Line</b></a>).
