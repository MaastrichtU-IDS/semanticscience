<h3><a href="usageconventions.html">Usage</a>:
 <BR><b>rotation</b> [ <i>rot-id</i> ] [ reverse ] <i>atom1 atom2</i></h3>
<h3><a href="usageconventions.html">Usage</a>:
 <BR><b>rotation</b> <i>rot-id</i> <i>angle</i> [ <i>frames</i> ]</h3>
<h3><a href="usageconventions.html">Usage</a>:
 <BR><b>~rotation</b> <i>rot-id</i></h3>
<p>
The <b>rotation</b> command activates a torsion (makes a bond rotatable)
or adjusts a previously activated torsion (rotates the bond).
The command <b>~rotation</b> freezes a bond in its current position and
makes it no longer rotatable.  Active torsions are listed in the
<a href="../../ContributedSoftware/structuremeas/structuremeas.html#adjust">
<b>Adjust Torsions</b> dialog</a> and can also be controlled with that tool.
</p><p>
When <i>atom1</i> and <i>atom2</i> are
<a href="atom_spec.html#basic">specified</a>, 
<b>rotation</b> makes the bond between them rotatable.  
If <i>rot-id</i> is not supplied, the next available integer will be used.
The order in which the atoms are specified is not important.
If the two atoms (only) are <a href="../selection.html">selected</a>,
they can be specified collectively with the word
<b>selected</b>, <b>sel</b>, or <b>picked</b>.  
The two atoms must be bonded, and the bond cannot be terminal 
(not attached to further atoms on either end) or part of a ring.  
Two rotations cannot affect a common set of atoms unless one affected set
is a complete subset of the other. That is, rotations must be properly nested.
The ability to activate a rotation does not imply that 
the bond is freely rotatable in the chemical sense; for example,
it could be a double bond.
By default, the smaller group of of atoms will move during bond rotation 
while the larger group remains fixed.
The <b>reverse</b> keyword indicates the larger group should move instead.
This keyword can only be specified at the time of activation, but
an already active torsion can be reversed using the
<a href="../../ContributedSoftware/structuremeas/structuremeas.html#adjust">
<b>Adjust Torsions</b> dialog</a>.
</p><p>
An already active torsion can be adjusted by specifying its <i>rot-id</i> 
along with the <i>angle</i> of change in degrees.  The rotation can be 
performed repeatedly for a specified number of <i>frames</i> 
(default <b>1</b>).
</p><p>
Examples: 
<blockquote>
<b>rotation 2 :16.b@ca,cb</b>
</blockquote>
- activate a rotation with ID number 2 around the CA-CB bond of residue 16
in chain B
<blockquote>
<b>rotation 2 &ndash;40</b>
</blockquote>
- adjust rotation 2 by &ndash;40&deg;
<blockquote>
<b>rotation #0:1@c:2@n</b>
</blockquote>
- activate a rotation around the bond between C in residue 1 and N in residue 2
of model 0
