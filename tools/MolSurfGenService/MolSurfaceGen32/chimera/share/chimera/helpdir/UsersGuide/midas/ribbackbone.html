By default, when ribbon is shown, 
<a href="../../ContributedSoftware/ribbonstyle/ribbonstyle.html#mainchain">mainchain atoms</a>
(backbone atoms) are hidden and their locations are adjusted 
to fall on the ribbon.
</p><p>
<b>Ribbackbone</b> allows all backbone atoms to be displayed at
their unadjusted positions together with ribbon 
(of course, these atoms can still be undisplayed).
<b>~Ribbackbone</b> restores the default behavior.
If the <a href="frameatom_spec.html" target="_top">
<i>atom-spec</i></a> is blank,
all open molecule models will be affected; otherwise,
the entire model(s) containing <a href="frameatom_spec.html" target="_top">
<i>atom-spec</i></a> will be affected.
Whether ribbon and backbone atoms can be displayed simultaneously
for residues within a model can also be controlled in the
<a href="../moleculeattrib.html">molecule model attributes panel</a>.
</p><p>
By default, when ribbon is shown:
<blockquote>
Of the <b>amino acid</b> mainchain atoms N, CA, C, and O,
only CA is displayed within most residues
(because it is bonded to side chain atoms).
Some N and C atoms remain displayed:
the N atom of the first residue in each stretch of ribbon (unless it
is the first residue in a chain) and the C atom of the last residue in
each stretch of ribbon (unless it is the last residue in a chain). 
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Of the <b>nucleic acid</b> mainchain atoms P, O1P, O2P, O5', C5', and O3',
only C5' and O3' are displayed within most residues
(because they are bonded to C4' and C3', respectively).
In addition, the P atom of the first residue in each stretch of ribbon 
(unless it is the first residue in a chain) remains displayed.
</blockquote>
The ribbon
<a href="../../ContributedSoftware/ribbonstyle/ribbonstyle.html#class">
residue class</a> determines which atoms are considered mainchain.
The <b>amino acid</b> and <b>nucleic acid</b> classes are built into Chimera,
but additional classes can be created and named with the
<a href="../../ContributedSoftware/ribbonstyle/ribbonstyle.html#class">
<b>Residue Class</b></a> section of the
<a href="../../ContributedSoftware/ribbonstyle/ribbonstyle.html"><b>Ribbon
Style Editor</b></a>.
