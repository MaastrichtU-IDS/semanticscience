<h3><a href="usageconventions.html">Usage</a>:
 <BR><b>wait</b> [ <i>wait_frames</i> ]</h3>
<p>
<b>Wait</b> suspends command processing for the given number of
<i>wait_frames</i> or, when no argument is supplied, until 
commands that execute over multiple frames have finished. 
Thus, <b>wait</b> can be used to enforce the ordered rather than
simultaneous execution of commands in
<a href="../indexcommand.html#cmdfile">scripts</a> and
<a href="../../ContributedSoftware/demos/demos.html">demos</a>.
For example, in the following:
<blockquote>
<b><A href="roll.html">roll</A> y 3 120; wait</b>
<br><b><a href="rock.html">rock</a> x 2 68</b>
</blockquote>
the <b>wait</b> command prevents the rock from starting until
the roll has finished.
</p><p>
<b>Wait</b> is also useful for generating duplicate image frames.  
Stretches of duplicate frames correspond to periods of time
where objects remain static.  If motion occurs 
in the last few frames of a <a href="../movies.html">movie</a>,
due to the encoding process it may appear to end on a blur.
This effect can be avoided by including a few wait frames 
(<b>wait 5</b> or similar) at the end of scripted
<a href="../movies.html#content">movie content</a>.
</p><p>
When a <a href="../indexcommand.html#cmdfile">script</a> is executed,
a single-frame display update (implicit <b>wait 1</b>)
will be added at the end of each line that:
(a) contains one or more commands that could change the display, and
(b) does not already end with an explicit <b>wait</b> of any length.
(Exception: display updates are not added when a script is executed
with <a href="read.html"><b>read</b></a>.)
