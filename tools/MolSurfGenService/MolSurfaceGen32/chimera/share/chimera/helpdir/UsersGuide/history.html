<h2>Command History</h2>

<table border="1" align="right" style="margin:8px 8px 8px 8px"> 
<tr><td><img src="hist.png" alt="Command History"></td></tr>
</table>
<p>
The <b>Command History</b> lists previously used
<a href="framecommand.html" target="_top">commands</a>.
The commands can be re-executed and/or saved to a file.
The <b>Command History</b> can be opened from the pulldown menu 
marked by a black triangle to the right of the 
<a href="chimerawindow.html#emulator"><b>Command Line</b></a>.
The menu also shows the most recently entered commands.
Commands are shown as entered even if they failed to execute 
due to mistyping or incorrect syntax.
</p><p>
In the <b>Command History</b>,
individual commands or blocks of commands may be
chosen (highlighted) using the left mouse button.
<b>Ctrl</b>-click adds to an existing choice rather than replacing it.
To choose a block of commands without dragging,
click on the first (or last) and then <b>Shift</b>-click on the
last (or first) in the desired block.
The choice of a single command, but not a block of commands, 
can be moved up and down the list
using the keyboard <b>up arrow</b> and <b>down arrow</b>
or <b>Ctrl-p</b> and <b>Ctrl-n</b>.
In the figure, three commands are chosen.
</p><p>
<b>Record...</b> brings up a <a href="opensave.html">dialog</a> 
for saving or appending commands to a
<a href="filetypes.html#command">file</a>.
The chosen commands or all commands in the history can be saved, 
as Chimera commands or their 
<a href="#translations">Python translations</a>.
</p><p>
<b>Execute</b> executes the chosen commands in the order shown;
double-clicking an individual command executes that command.
<b>Delete</b> removes the chosen commands from the history.
</p><p>
<b>Close</b> dismisses the <b>Command History</b> window; <b>Help</b> opens
this manual page in a browser window.
</p><p>
Recently used commands are saved upon exiting from Chimera and will appear 
in the <b>Command History</b> of the next session that uses the same
<a href="preferences.html#preffile"><b>preferences</b> file</a>.
How many commands to remember between sessions is specified in the
<a href="preferences.html#Command Line"><b>Command Line</b> preferences</a>.
</p>

<h3><a name="translations">Python Translations</a> of Commands</h3>
<p>
A file containing the Python translations of commands cannot be executed in
Chimera until statements to import any necessary modules have been added.
In some cases, adding
<tt><pre>
import Midas
</pre></tt>
to the beginning of the file will be sufficient;
however, additional modules may need to be imported,
depending on the particular commands included
and any further code that is added to the file.
</p><p>
A Python script can be executed by simply
<a href="filetypes.html">opening</a> it in Chimera,
or if it has command-line arguments, using the command
<b><A href="midas/runscript.html">runscript</A></b> or the
startup option <b><A href="options.html#script">--script</A></b>.
