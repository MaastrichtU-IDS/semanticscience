<h4>NAME</h4>
  <h3>conic - generate CPK-style molecular models with shadows</h3>

<h4>SYNOPSIS</h4>
<h3>
  <b>conic</b> [ -p ] [ -f <i>output-format</i> ] [ -s ] [ -a <i>mode</i> ]
 [ -o <i>output-file</i> ] [ -x <i>pixels-wide</i> ] [ -y <i>pixels-high</i> ]
 [ -c <i>config-file</i> ] [ -e <i>shell-command</i> ] [ -t ] [ -v ] [ -A ]
 [ -C ] [ -F ] [ -S <i>scale_factor</i> ] [ -W ] [ <i>PDB-file</i> ]
</h3>

<h4>DESCRIPTION</h4>
<p>
  <b>Conic</b> reads a Protein Data Bank file and generates a 
  Corey-Pauling-Koltun style
  image of the molecule. If no PDB file is specified, standard input is
  used.	 There can be an arbitrary number of light sources.  Specular
  highlights, diffuse reflections, and shadows are all computed properly.
</p><p>
<a name="note1">
  *</a>The <a href="#pdbfile"><i>PDB-file</i></a>
  argument should not be given when <b>conic</b> is used from within Chimera.
</p><p>
<a name="note2">
  *</a>On <b>Mac</b> systems, either the <a href="#oflag"><b>-o</b></a> flag
   or the configuration file <a href="#output"><b>output</b></a> option
   must be used to generate any output at all.  If display is desired in
   addition to an output file, the
   <a href="#sflag"><b>-s</b></a> flag should also be used.
</p>

<h4>COMMAND-LINE ARGUMENTS</h4>

<blockquote>
  <tt><b>-p</b></tt>   
<br>Use preview mode.  Set the image size to 645 x 484 and antialias mode to
       none (see the <a href="#aflag"><b>-a</b></a> flag).
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<a name="sflag">
  <tt><b>-s</b></tt></a>
<br>
     Display the computed image file;
     meaningful only when used in conjunction with the 
     <a href="#oflag"><b>-o</b></a> flag
     or the configuration file <a href="#output"><b>output</b></a> option.
     Mac users, see the <a href="#note2">note</a> above.
     The <b>-s</b> flag works only on Linux, Mac, and SGI systems, and
     not all <a href="#fflag">formats</a> can be displayed on all systems.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<a name="aflag">
  <tt><b>-a</b> <i>mode</i></tt></a>
     <br>Set the antialias mode.  <i>Mode</i> is the same as the argument to
     the <a href="#antialias"><b>antialias</b></a> option
     in the configuration file.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<a name="oflag">
  <tt><b>-o</b> <i>file</i></tt></a>
    <br>Store the computed image in <i>file</i> in the selected
    <a href="#fflag">format</a>.
    The image will not be displayed unless <a href="#sflag"><b>-s</b></a>
    is also specified.  Mac users, see the <a href="#note2">note</a> above.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <tt><b>-x</b> <i>size</i></tt>
       <br>Set the horizontal image size to <i>size</i> pixels.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <tt><b>-y</b> <i>size</i></tt>
       <br>Set the vertical image size to <i>size</i> pixels.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <tt><b>-e</b> <i>shell-command</i></tt>
 <br>Execute <i>shell-command</i> when the image has finished drawing and exit
       when the command is done.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <tt><b>-c</b> <i>file</i></tt>
       <br>Use <i>file</i> as the <b>conic</b> configuration file.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<a name="fflag">
  <tt><b>-f</b> <i>output-format</i></tt></a>
   <br>Possible <i>output-format</i> settings are: 
       <ul>
       <li><b>screen</b>
       - screen display instead of a file
       (not available on Mac systems, see the <a href="#note2">note</a> above).
       <b>Screen</b> is the default when no output file is requested
       (when neither <a href="#oflag"><b>-o</b></a> nor the configuration
       file <a href="#output"><b>output</b></a> option is used).
       <li><b>ps</b> - Encapsulated PostScript file; see also the 
       <a href="#Hflag"><b>-H</b></a> option
       <li><b>sgi</b> - SGI image file; the default output file format
       on SGI systems
       <li><b>tiff</b> - TIFF file; the default output file format
       on systems other than SGI
       </ul>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <tt><b>-t</b></tt>
<br>   Make the background color transparent.  This only works when writing
       output to SGI and TIFF image files, and it adds an alpha channel to
       the file so that the resulting image can be composited onto other
       backgrounds.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <tt><b>-v</b></tt>
<br>   Print progress messages.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <tt><b>-A</b></tt>
<br>   Ignore USER COLOR, USER RADIUS, and USER MATPROP records present in
       the input file.	Since the <a href="pdbrun.html"><b>pdbrun</b></a>
       command provides USER COLOR and USER RADIUS records for each atom,
       this flag must be used if atomic information is coming from Chimera,
       but a color scheme specified in an atom information file is desired
       (see <a href="#coloring">COLORING THE MOLECULE</a>).
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <tt><b>-C</b></tt>
<br>   Force <b>conic</b> to display full spheres at the near clipping plane.
  This option affects those spheres whose centers lie across the near clipping
    plane from the viewer, but whose nearest extent crosses the clipping
    plane (<b>conic</b> always discards spheres whose centers are closer
    than the clipping plane).  By default, <b>conic</b> shows the sphere with a
    portion "cut away."  With this option, the entire sphere is shown.
    It should be noted that the "cut away" depiction is inaccurate in
    two regards: the partially cut spheres still cast full shadows, and no
    part of a sphere is shown if its center is in front of the clipping
    plane, even though it may extend through the plane.  Typically, these
    inaccuracies are not noticeable, but in some situations (such as
    when point light sources are used) they may produce odd-looking results.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <tt><b>-F</b></tt>
<br>   Set the image size to be the full screen.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<a name="Hflag">
  <tt><b>-H</b></tt></a>
<br>   If the output format is <b>ps</b>
 (see the <a href="#fflag"><b>-f</b></a> and
 <a href="#oflag"><b>-o</b></a> flags), causes binary data to be hex-encoded.
       Though raw binary format is more space-efficient, many printers cannot
       print binary data unless it is hex-encoded.  Note that future versions
       of <b>conic</b> may make hex-encoding the default (and the <b>-H</b>
       flag would turn it off).
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <tt><b>-S</b> <i>scale_factor</i></tt>
       <br>Zoom in on the center of the image by the specified factor.
       The size of the window remains unchanged.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <tt><b>-W</b></tt>
<br>   Force Chimera to wait until <b>conic</b> has exited before continuing.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<a name="pdbfile">
  <tt><i>PDB-file</i></tt></a>
       <br>Indicates the name of the input PDB file.
       If no <i>PDB-file</i> is given, the data is read from standard input.
       See the <a href="#note1">note</a> above.
</blockquote>

<h4><a name="conicdat">CONFIGURATION FILE</a></h4>
<p>
  The scene computed by <b>conic</b> is described by a list of options in a
  configuration file.
  If the configuration file is absent, or the option is omitted,
  then a default value will be used.  Lines beginning with `#' are comments
  and are ignored.  All other lines are options, which begin with a
  keyword and are followed by space-separated values.  The available options
  are listed below.
</p>

<blockquote>
  <tt><b>ambient</b> <i>r g b</i></tt>
       <br>Set the ambient light to the given RGB value, which is three
       floating-point intensities ranging from 0 to 1.	The default ambient
       lighting is (0.2 0.2 0.2).
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<a name="antialias">
  <tt><b>antialias</b> <i>mode</i></tt></a>
       <br>Set the antialiasing algorithm.
    <i>Mode</i> may be <b>none</b>, for no antialiasing;
       <b>3/2</b>, for mapping 3x3 calculation pixels onto 2x2 image pixels; or
       <b>2x2</b>, for mapping 2x2 calculation pixels onto single image pixels.
       Antialiasing improves the picture quality at the expense of computation
       time.  The time increase is proportional to the number of pixels
       computed modulo the startup time.  Thus, for small molecules, which
       have low startup times, going from none to 2x2 will increase the
       computation time four-fold.  The relative increase is less for large
       molecules since the startup time for large molecules is a significant
       fraction of total computation time.  The default <i>mode</i> is none.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <tt><b>atinfo</b> <i>file</i></tt>
       <br>Use <i>file</i> as the atom information file, which contains
       default atomic radii and information on 
       how each type of atom should be colored.
       Coloring the molecule is described in greater detail below.  This
       option has no effect if <b>conic</b> is invoked from within Chimera,
       as Chimera fully specifies the atom colors and
       <a href="vdwrad.html">radii</a>.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <tt><b>background</b> <i>r g b</i> [<i>r g b</i> [ <i>r g b</i> ] ]</tt>
       <br>Set the background color for the image.  If only one RGB value is
       given, then the entire background is set in that color.	If two RGB
       values are given, then the background is interpolated between the two
       colors from bottom to top. If three RGB values are specified, then the
       background is smoothly interpolated from the first color at the bottom
       of the image to the second color in the middle to the third color at
       the top.	 The default background color is black (0 0 0).
       NOTE: if this option is given in the configuration file,
       it will override any color specified in the input PDB file.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <tt><b>cone</b> <i>x y z r g b dx dy dz angle</i></tt>
       <br>Define a cone light.  The absolute Cartesian coordinates of the light
       source are (<i>x y z</i>).  The color of the light is given by (<i>
       r g b</i>).  The Cartesian direction of the cone light is given by
     (<i>dx dy dz</i>), and the half-angle of the cone is <i>angle</i> degrees.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <tt><b>eye</b> <i>r g b</i></tt>
  <br><b>Conic</b> places an additional point light source which coincides
    with the eye position.  The purpose of this light source is to weakly
    illuminate shadowed areas so that they have discernible features
    rather than a uniform color.  The <b>eye</b> option sets the color of the
    point light source.  The default value is (0.3 0.3 0.3).
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <tt><b>format</b> <i>output-format</i></tt>
  <br>See the <a href="#fflag"><b>-f</b></a> option for possible
  <i>output-format</i> settings.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<a name="fov">
  <tt><b>fov</b> <i>angle</i></tt></a>
       <br><i>Angle</i> is the field-of-view half-angle; the
       default is 15 degrees.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <tt><b>input</b> <i>file</i></tt>
       <br>Use <i>file</i> as the Protein Data Bank file.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <tt><b>light</b> <i>x y z r g b</i></tt>
       <br>Add an infinite light source to the scene being computed.
  The direction of the light source is specified by (<i>x y z</i>).
  The color of the light source is specified by (<i>r g b</i>).
  By default, <b>conic</b> defines a light source with direction
 (1 1 1) and color (1 1 1).  The default light source is removed if other
 sources are specified via the <b>light</b> option.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <tt><b>location</b> <i>x y</i></tt>
       <br>Sets the image location on the screen.  This parameter is only
       meaningful if the
       output is to the screen, <i>i.e.</i>, for output format <b>screen</b>.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <tt><b>ls_flags</b> <i>flag</i></tt>
       <br>Change the behavior of subsequently specified light sources.
       The value of <i>flag</i> may be <b>noshadow</b> or <b>shadow</b>.
       By default, a light source only shines on a point if there are no
       intervening spheres.
       If <b>noshadow</b> is specified, however, all
       points are considered to be lit.  Using
       <b>shadow</b> will undo the effects of <b>noshadow</b>
       for subsequent light sources.  <b>Noshadow</b>
       is generally used if the scene is very complex and
       shadows make the resulting image difficult to interpret.  This problem
       may also be mitigated by using multiple light sources.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<a name="matprop">
  <tt><b>matprop</b> <i>kd ks power</i></tt></a>
       <br>Define default material properties.  <i>Kd</i>
       is the diffuse reflection coefficient.
   <i>Ks</i> is the specular reflection coefficient.  <i>Power</i> controls
       how sharply defined a specular light is, and must be a positive
       even integer.  The higher the value of power, the smaller the specular
       reflection area.	 The default values are 0.5, 0.25, and 8, respectively.
       <i>Kd</i> and <i>ks</i> must be in the range 0-1, and
       <i>power</i> must be 2 or higher.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<a name="output">
  <tt><b>output</b> <i>file</i></tt></a>
  <br>Store the computed image in <i>file</i> in the selected
  <a href="#fflag">format</a>; 
  equivalent to using <a href="#oflag"><b>-o</b></a>.
  Mac users, see the <a href="#note2">note</a> above.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <tt><b>point</b> <i>x y z r g b</i></tt>
       <br>Define a point light source.  The arguments are the same as those for
       the <b>light</b> option, except that
       (<i>x y z</i>) defines the light position rather than direction.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <tt><b>quad</b> <i>x1 y1 z1 x2 y2 z2 x3 y3 z3</i></tt>
       <br>Define a quadrilateral (actually a parallelogram) in the image.
Since the quad is a parallelogram, only three vertices are necessary to
       define it.  Quads are "second-class" objects: They can be in shadow
       from first-class objects (spheres), but cannot cast shadows
       themselves.
       In fact, they cannot even block first-class objects; first-class
       objects show through.  Quads are typically used to construct
       large background areas that show the shadow of the scene as a whole.
       For best results, there are two important things to note.  First, the
       default field-of-view for <b>conic</b> is quite narrow, and if you do
       not see
       an expected shadow it may be because it is falling outside the field
       of view.	 In such a case, you may want to expand the field of view
       half-angle (using the <a href="#fov"><b>fov</b></a> option)
       from the default 15
       degrees to 25 or 30 degrees.  The second thing to note is that
       because of ambient light, shadows will not be black.  If you desire
       black shadows, turn off ambient lighting (using the <b>ambient</b>
       option, above).
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<tt><b>quad_color</b> <i>r1 g1 b1</i> [ <i>r2 g2 b2 r3 g3 b3 r4 g4 b4</i> ]</tt>
   <br>Define the vertex colors of following quads.  The interior color of
       the quad will be smoothly interpolated between the vertex colors.  If
       only one RGB triple is specified, all vertices will have that color.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <tt><b>rcone</b> <i>x y z r g b dx dy dz angle</i></tt>
       <br><b>Rcone</b> is to <b>cone</b> as <b>rpoint</b> is to <b>point</b>.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <tt><b>rpoint</b> <i>x y z r g b</i></tt>
       <br>Define a point light source relative to the scene, similar to 
       <b>point</b>.  The (<i>x y z</i>) coordinate is relative to the
       center of the scene, with
       lengths normalized such that the distance from the eye to the center
       of the scene is 1.  Thus, the option
<blockquote><tt>
       rpoint 0 0 1 1 1 1
</tt></blockquote>
       would define a point light source that coincided with the eye, whereas
<blockquote><tt>
       rpoint 0 2 0 1 1 1
</tt></blockquote>
       would define a point light source directly above the center of the
       scene, twice as far above the scene as the distance from the center of
       the scene to the eye.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <tt><b>rquad</b> <i>x1 y1 z1 x2 y2 z2 x3 y3 z3</i></tt>
       <br><b>Rquad</b> is to <b>quad</b> as <b>rpoint</b> is to <b>point</b>.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <tt><b>rspot</b> <i>x y z r g b dx dy dz power</i></tt>
       <br><b>Rspot</b> is to <b>spot</b> as <b>rpoint</b> is to <b>point</b>.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <tt><b>size</b> <i>x y</i></tt>
     <br>Sets the image size.  The default image size is 1280 x 1024.
      If <b>conic</b> is invoked from within Chimera, then the default
      image size will be the same as the Chimera window size.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <tt><b>spot</b> <i>x y z r g b dx dy dz power</i></tt>
       <br>Define a spotlight.  The absolute Cartesian coordinates of the light
       source are (<i>x y z</i>).  The color of the light is given by
       (<i>r g b</i>).  The
       Cartesian direction of the spotlight is given by (<i>dx dy dz</i>).  The
       intensity of the spotlight drops off as the angle between the
       spotlight direction and the pixel direction; the rate of decrease is
       the cosine of the angle raised to the <i>power</i>th power.
       <i>Power</i> must be an
       even integer; odd integers will be incremented silently.
</blockquote>

<a name="coloring">
<h4>COLORING THE MOLECULE</h4>
</a>
<p>
  <b>Conic</b> uses two sources of atom radius and coloring information.
  If neither
  source of information yields a radius and color for an atom, then the atom
  is ignored.
</p><p>
  The first source is embedded in the input to <b>conic</b>, which is an
  extended
  Protein Data Bank format.  The format is identical to standard PDB format
  except that ATOM and HETATM records may be preceded by USER records, whose
  text field contains a keyword and some values.
  (The <a href="pdbrun.html"><b>pdbrun</b></a> command
  generates output of this format.)  The keywords that <b>conic</b> uses are
  COLOR, RADIUS, and MATPROP.  COLOR is followed by three floating-point RGB
  intensities and a color name.  RADIUS is followed by a floating-point
  number representing the atom radius in angstroms.  MATPROP is followed
  by the three parameters to the <a href="#matprop"><b>matprop</b></a>
  option in the configuration file.
  Once COLOR, RADIUS, or MATPROP is given, it applies to all of the
  succeeding atoms in the file.
</p><p>
  If the input fails to specify the color, radius, or material properties of
  an atom, <b>conic</b> uses an atom information file to supply missing
  values.  The file contains comment lines, which begin with <b>#</b>,
  and information  lines,
  which have either five or eight fields:  atom type, radius, an RGB triple,
  and optionally three material property values (see the
  <a href="#matprop"><b>matprop</b></a>
  keyword in the configuration file
  section for the meaning of material property fields
  and their default values).  The atom type is either one or two characters
  and is used to match the atom type in the PDB input.  The atom type
  <b>*</b> is
  a special case and matches any atom which does not match any other
  information lines.
  Using	an atom information file, simple color-by-type images
  may be generated from raw PDB files.
</p><p>
The default atom information file
<a href="conic.atinfo">conic.atinfo</a> contains the following parameters:
