<h2>Help</h2>
<p>
Extensive help is available for Chimera;
the <a href="index.html" target="_top"><b>User's Guide</b></a> and
<a href="../ProgrammersGuide/index.html" target="_top"><b>Programmer's
Guide</b></a> are written in HTML and can be displayed using the
web browser of choice.  This HTML documentation is bundled with a 
Chimera download and can be accessed from the Chimera <b>Help</b> menu.
Use of the bundled documentation is recommended
because it is synchronized with the locally installed version of Chimera.
(The development version of the <b>User's Guide</b> is
<a href="http://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/docindex.html"
target="_blank">available online</a> for viewing,
but may describe features that have not yet been released.)

To call up the manual page for a specific 
<a href="framecommand.html" target="_top"><i>command</i></a>, type
into the <a href="chimerawindow.html#emulator"><b>Command Line</b></a>:
<blockquote><tt>
<a href="midas/help.html"><b>help</b></a> <i>command</i>
</tt></blockquote>
For example,
<blockquote><tt>
<a href="midas/help.html"><b>help</b></a> <b>color</b>
</tt></blockquote>
</p><p>
Many of the tools and interfaces have <b>Help</b> buttons that
open their respective manual pages.  Some tools and interfaces also supply
<a name="balloon">
<b>balloon help</b>, explanatory text that pops up when the cursor is left
in certain positions.
</a>
When the cursor is left over an atom or bond in the graphics window, 
an <b>atomspec balloon</b> appears.  Atomspec
balloons contain information such as atom name, residue number, and
(for bonds) length.
Their style is controlled in the
<a href="preferences.html#General"><b>General</b> preferences</a>.
Balloon help and atomspec balloons are on by default, but can be turned
off in the <a href="preferences.html#General"><b>General</b> preferences</a>.
