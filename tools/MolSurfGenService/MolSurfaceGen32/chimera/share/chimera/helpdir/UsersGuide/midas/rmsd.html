<h3><a href="usageconventions.html">Usage</a>:
 <BR><b>rmsd</b>
<a href="atom_spec.html#basic"><i>atom-spec1</i></a>
<a href="atom_spec.html#basic"><i>atom-spec2</i></a></h3>
<p>
The <b>rmsd</b> command evaluates the root-mean-square deviation
(RMSD) between specified sets of atoms.  It differs from
<a href="match.html"><b>match</b></a> in that no least-squares fit
is performed (no model is moved).
<a href="atom_spec.html#basic"><i>Atom-spec1</i></a> and
<a href="atom_spec.html#basic"><i>atom-spec2</i></a>
should contain equal numbers of atoms from two different models, respectively.
The atoms need not be connected.
Atoms are paired according to the order in which they are specified,
<i>i.e.</i>, the first atom of the first model is paired with the first atom
of the second model, the second atom to the second atom, and so on.
</p><p>
If atom order is not specified, for example,
<blockquote>
<b>rmsd #1:fad #0:fad</b>
<!-- example structures 1f3p and 1lvl -->
<br>
<b>rmsd #2:246,295 #0:195,221</b>
<!-- example structures 4enl #2 and 2mnr #0 -->
</blockquote>
the atoms within a residue are ordered first by name,
and where these are identical, by alternate location identifier, and where
these are also identical, by serial number.
</p><p>
All of the atoms (from both models) can be specified collectively
using the word <b>selected</b>, <b>sel</b>, or <b>picked</b> if the
current <a href="../selection.html">selection</a> contains
equal numbers of atoms from each model.  The atoms should have
been <a href="../selection.html">selected</a>
(most likely <a href="../selection.html#pickselect">picked</a>)
in the proper order, first the desired atoms from one model,
then the corresponding atoms in the corresponding order from the other model.
When order information is lacking
(for example, the atoms were selected simultaneously),
the measurement may not be the one intended.
