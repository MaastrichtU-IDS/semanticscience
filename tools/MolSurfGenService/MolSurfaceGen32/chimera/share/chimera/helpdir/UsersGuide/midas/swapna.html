<h3><a href="usageconventions.html">Usage</a>:
 <BR><b>swapna</b> <i>new_type</i>
<a href="frameatom_spec.html" target="_top"><i>atom-spec</i></a></h3>
<p>
<b>Swapna</b> "mutates" nucleic acid residues by replacing
their base moieties.  Every residue with at least one atom in
<a href="frameatom_spec.html" target="_top"><i>atom-spec</i></a>
is changed to a <i>new_type</i> residue.
<i>New_type</i> is a one-letter code representing
one of the standard nucleic acid bases: A, T, G, C, or U
(case is unimportant).
The geometries of the new residues may not be optimal.
</p><p>
The temperature factor for the new residue is set to the highest
currently found in the model.
