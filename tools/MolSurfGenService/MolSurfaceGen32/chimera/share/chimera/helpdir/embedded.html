<h2>Software Embedded in UCSF Chimera</h2>

<blockquote><p>
The list below includes links to 
where you can obtain the source-code distributions
for some of the software packages incorporated into Chimera.
All of this software comes bundled with the Chimera release;
the links are included here mainly for completeness.
In principle, you could upgrade to newer versions of these packages,
but it is recommended you wait for a new Chimera release instead, 
primarily because we incorporate bug fixes and enchancements that
may not have been added to the directly distributed versions yet.
<p>
