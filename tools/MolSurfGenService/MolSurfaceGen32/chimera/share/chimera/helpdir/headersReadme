This bundle includes the header files to the C++ component of Chimera.

The _chimera directory is the core -- loaded at startup and containing the
basic components of Chimera.  Besides the .h files there, there is a file
named pyinterface that shows the declarations for compilation units used
by _chimera that aren't directly in _chimera.  This includes such basic
classes as Atom, Molecule, etc.

The program that creates the Python API from these headers is called
"wrappy" and therefore the parts of the headers (and pyinterface) embedded in
"#ifndef wrappy" directives will not be exposed in Python (typically these
have arguments that wrappy is not sophisticated enough to handle yet).
