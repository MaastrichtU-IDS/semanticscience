<h3>Measure Volume and Area 
<img src="measureicon.png" alt="Measure Volume and Area icon"></h3>
<p>
<b>Measure Volume and Area</b> 
reports the total surface area and enclosed volume of a 
<a href="../../UsersGuide/surfattrib.html#surfmodels">surface model</a>.
To measure individual disconnected blobs within a single surface model, use
<a href="../pickblobs/pickblobs.html"><b>Measure and Color Blobs</b></a> 
instead.  These tools compute surface area and enclosed volume
from surface triangles rather than analytically.  See also:
<a href="../../UsersGuide/midas/measure.html"><b>measure</b></a>,
<a href="../surfvol/surfvol.html"><b>Area/Volume from Web</b></a>
</p><p>
Note that when a
<a href="../../UsersGuide/representation.html#surfaces">molecular
surface</a> is generated, the total analytical solvent-accessible and 
solvent-excluded areas are automatically reported in the 
<a href="../../UsersGuide/reply.html"><b>Reply Log</b></a>,
and the values per atom and residue are assigned as 
<a href="../defineattrib/defineattrib.html#attribdef">attributes</a>
named <b>areaSAS</b> and <b>areaSES</b>.
</p><p>
There are <a href="../../UsersGuide/extension.html">several ways to start</a>
<b>Measure Volume and Area</b>, a tool in the 
<b>Surface/Binding Analysis</b> and <b>Volume Data</b> categories
(including from the <a href="../volumeviewer/framevolumeviewer.html"
target="_top"><b>Volume Viewer</b></a> <b>Tools</b> menu).
</p><p>
The surface of interest should be chosen from the <b>Surface</b> menu.
The surface area and enclosed volume are reported in the dialog 
and written to the <a href="../../UsersGuide/reply.html"><b>Reply Log</b></a>.
Values reflect the physical units of the data, usually
&Aring;<sup>3</sup> for volume and &Aring;<sup>2</sup> for area.  
</p><p>
Surfaces are composed of triangles.
Anything that changes the positions of the vertices in a surface
will change its area and enclosed volume, for example:
<ul>
<li>adjusting the contour level of an isosurface shown with 
<a href="../../ContributedSoftware/volumeviewer/framevolumeviewer.html"
target="_top"><b>Volume Viewer</b></a>
<li>smoothing a
<a href="../../ContributedSoftware/multiscale/framemulti.html" target="_top">
<b>Multiscale Models</b></a> surface
<li>changing the <b>probe radius</b> or <b>vertex density</b>
<a href="../../UsersGuide/msmsattrib.html">attribute</a> of a
<a href="../../UsersGuide/representation.html#surfaces">molecular surface</a>
</ul>
<b>Update automatically</b> (on by default) indicates volume and area
should be recomputed automatically whenever such a change occurs.
Otherwise, a new calculation can be triggered  by clicking <b>Update</b>.
A current limitation is that changes in
<a href="../../UsersGuide/representation.html#surfaces">molecular surfaces</a>
are not detected automatically (the <b>Update</b> button must always be used).

<h4>TECHNICAL NOTES</h4></a>
<p>
<b>Clipping and hiding are ignored.</b>
The volume calculation uses the full surface, 
even if part of it is hidden by clipping planes or zoning
(with <a href="../surfzone/surfzone.html"><b>Surface Zone</b></a>
or <a href="../volumeviewer/volumeviewer.html#zone">zoning</a> in
<a href="../../ContributedSoftware/volumeviewer/framevolumeviewer.html"
target="_top"><b>Volume Viewer</b></a>).
</p>

<p>
<b>Surface holes.</b> 
The volume enclosed by a surface with holes is calculated by assuming
each hole has a planar cap.  These caps are not displayed or included in
the surface area determination.  The number of holes is reported, as
planar caps may not represent missing data very well.
<a href="../../ContributedSoftware/multiscale/framemulti.html" target="_top">
<b>Multiscale Models</b></a> surfaces should never have holes.
Holes in a contour surface from
<a href="../volumeviewer/framevolumeviewer.html"
target="_top"><b>Volume Viewer</b></a> may occur at the boundary of the data,
but by default these will already be covered with
<a href="../../ContributedSoftware/volumeviewer/volumeviewer.html#caphigh">
planar caps</a>.  Such boundary caps will be included in 
the surface area calculation and will not be reported as holes.
