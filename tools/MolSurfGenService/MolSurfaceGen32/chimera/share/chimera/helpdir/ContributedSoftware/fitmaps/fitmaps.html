<b>Fit in Map</b> fits atomic coordinates into a density map or
one density map into another.
Local optima are found, not necessarily the global optimum.
The maps usually represent electron density, but other types of
<a href="../../UsersGuide/filetypes.html#volume">volume data</a> 
can also be used.  See also:
<a href="../density/density.html"><b>Values at Atom Positions</b></a>,

There are <a href="../../UsersGuide/extension.html">several ways to start</a>
<b>Fit in Map</b>, a tool in the <b>Volume Data</b> category
(including from the <a href="../volumeviewer/framevolumeviewer.html"
target="_top"><b>Volume Viewer</b></a> <b>Tools</b> menu).
</p><p>
The atomic structures and/or map(s) of interest should first
be <a href="../../UsersGuide/filetypes.html">opened</a> in Chimera.
The <a name="fitmodel"><b><i>fit model</i></b></a> (atoms or map to fit)
and <a name="refmodel"><b><i>reference map</i></b></a>
can then be chosen from the respective menus in the <b>Fit in Map</b> dialog.  
Prior to optimization, the fit model should be placed in a trial position 
relative to the reference map, close to what might be correct.  
This usually involves <a href="../../UsersGuide/mouse.html">interactive
manipulation</a> and toggling models between
<a href="../../UsersGuide/mouse.html#activedef">active</a> and immovable states.
When atoms are fit, an entire molecule model or the currently
<a href="../../UsersGuide/selection.html">selected</a> atoms can be used.
</p><p>
Clicking <b>Fit</b> performs steepest-ascent
<a href="#optimization">local optimization</a> of the fit
(<a href="#fitatoms">atoms-in-map</a> or <a href="#fitmaps">map-in-map</a>)
using the current <a href="#options">options</a>.
The calculation will stop and the <a href="#fitmodel">fit model</a> 
will be repositioned after the earliest of:
<ul>
<li><a href="#convergence">convergence</a>
<li>100 steepest-ascent steps have been performed
<li>when <b>Halt</b> is clicked
</ul>
Clicking <b>Fit</b> again may further improve the results,
especially if <a href="#convergence">convergence</a> was not reached.
<b>Undo</b> backtracks through transformations
of the <a href="#fitmodel">fit model</a> relative to the 
<a href="#refmodel">reference map</a> applied by <b>Fit in Map</b>,
whereas <b>Redo</b> reapplies them.
</p><p>
<a href="../findclash/findclash.html"><b>Find Clashes/Contacts</b></a>
can be used to monitor for close contacts between atomic structures
as they are moved, and atomic coordinates can be 
<a href="../../UsersGuide/savemodel.html">saved</a>
relative to the <a href="#refmodel">reference map</a>.
</p><p>
Clicking
<b>Update</b> gives the current <a href="#fitatoms">atoms-in-map</a> and/or 
<a href="#fitmaps">map-in-map</a> fit values without performing any fitting.
</p><p>
Clicking <b>Results</b> opens the
<a href="../../UsersGuide/reply.html"><b>Reply Log</b></a>,
which along with the fit values reports the
number of steps taken and <a href="#fitmodel">fit model</a> displacement
(translational shift and angle of rotation) since <b>Fit</b> was clicked.
The transformation of the <a href="#fitmodel">fit model</a> 
relative to the <a href="#refmodel">reference map</a>
is described with a <a href="#matrices">transformation matrix</a> and
as an axis of rotation (a unit vector), point on the axis,
degrees of rotation, and shift parallel to the axis.
</p><p>
<a name="options">Clicking <b>Options</b></a> reveals additional settings
(clicking the close button <img src ="../volumeviewer/x.png"</a> on the right
hides them again):
<ul>
<li> <b>Real-time correlation / average update</b> 
- update fit values continuously as a model is moved
<li> <b>Use map simulated from atoms, resolution</b> [<i>r</i>] 
- generate a density map from the <a href="#fitmodel">fit model</a> 
atomic coordinates and use <a href="#fitmaps">map-in-map</a> fitting 
(but report both 
<a href="#fitatoms">atoms-in-map</a> and <a href="#fitmaps">map-in-map</a> 
fit values). The map is generated by describing each atom as a 
Gaussian distribution of width proportional to <i>r</i> and
amplitude proportional to the atomic number (other parameters set to
<a href="../../UsersGuide/midas/molmap.html"><b>molmap</b></a> defaults).
<li> <b>Use only data above contour level from first map</b>
- exclude data outside the <a href="#fitmodel">fit map</a> 
contour surface from <a href="#fitmaps">map-in-map</a> fitting
<li> whether to <b>Optimize</b> the <a href="#overlap"><b>overlap</b></a>
or the <a href="#correlation"><b>correlation</b></a>
during <a href="#fitmaps">map-in-map</a> fitting
<li> whether to <b>Allow</b> <a href="#fitmodel">fit model</a> <b>rotation</b> 
and/or <b>shift</b> movements
<li> <b>Move whole molecules</b> - when fitting selected atoms,
whether to move just those atoms or the entire molecule model(s) containing them
</ul>

<a name="fitatoms">
Atoms-in-map fitting</a>: 
<blockquote>
The average map value at fit atom positions is maximized.
For each atom within the bounds of the <a href="#refmodel">reference map</a>,
the map value is found by trilinear interpolation
from the eight corners of the enclosing data grid cell.
Atoms outside the bounds of the map are not used for computing averages.
</blockquote>
<a name="fitmaps">
Map-in-map fitting</a>:
<blockquote>
Either the overlap or the correlation can be maximized.
The calculation can include all nonzero-valued fit map grid points 
or only those with values above the map's lowest contour level in
<a href="../../ContributedSoftware/volumeviewer/framevolumeviewer.html"
target="_top"><b>Volume Viewer</b></a> (see <a href="#options">options</a>).
The <a name="overlap"><b><i>overlap</i></b></a> is
the sum over fit map grid points of the product of the fit
map value and the <a href="#refmodel">reference map</a> value at that point, 
determined by trilinear interpolation. 
It can be expressed as the inner product of 
vectors <b>u</b> and <b>v</b> containing the fit map values 
and the corresponding interpolated reference map values:
<blockquote>
<b><i>overlap</i></b> = &lt;<b>u</b>,<b>v</b>&gt;
</blockquote>
<a name="correlation">In similar notation</a>,
<blockquote>
<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"> 
<tr><td></td><td valign="bottom">
&lt;<b>u</b>&ndash;<b>u</b><sub>ave</sub>,<b>v</b>&ndash;<b>v</b><sub>ave</sub>&gt;
</td></tr>
<tr><td><b><i>correlation</b></i> =&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
<td height="1"><hr></td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td valign="top">
|<b>u</b>&ndash;<b>u</b><sub>ave</sub>||<b>v</b>&ndash;<b>v</b><sub>ave</sub>|
</td></tr>
</table>
</blockquote>
where <b>u</b><sub>ave</sub> is a vector with all components equal to the 
average of the components of <b>u</b> and <b>v</b><sub>ave</sub> is 
defined analogously.
The correlation differs from the overlap
in that an average value is first subtracted from each component, and further,
the inner product of the resulting vectors is normalized by the 
lengths of those vectors.
The correlation equals the cosine of the angle between the vectors
(after subtraction of averages) and can range from &ndash;1 to 1, whereas
the range of overlap values depends on the scaling of the maps.

<h4>NOTES</h4></a>

<p>
<a name="optimization">
<b>Optimization algorithm</b>.</a>
If rotation and translation are both allowed, every even step is
a translation and every odd step is a rotation.
The center of rotation is the centroid (average position) of the
fit atoms or the geometric center of the fit map grid points.
The initial step size is chosen so that
the largest displacement is 0.5 grid units,
where a grid unit is the spacing between 
<a href="#refmodel">reference map</a> grid points.
If after four steps the maximum cumulative displacement is less
than half the displacement achievable if all steps were in the same
direction (<i>e.g.</i>, half of 2.0 grid units = 1 grid unit),
the step size is halved.  Successive rounds of four steps with fixed
step size and halving the step size based on the maximum displacement
criterion are repeated until
<a name="convergence">
step size falls below 0.01 grid unit (<b><i>convergence</i></b>)
</a>
or 100 steps have been taken.  Map value gradients at atom positions 
or fit map points are calculated using trilinear interpolation 
of the gradients at the <a href="#refmodel">reference map</a> points.
Gradients at grid points are calculated by the center difference method.
Atoms or fit map points outside the <a href="#refmodel">reference map</a>
or within one voxel of the edge of the data at a given step 
do not contribute to the optimal direction at that step.
</p>

<p>
<a name="matrices"><b>Transformation matrices</b></a>.
The transformation matrix of the <a href="#fitmodel">fit model</a> 
relative to the <a href="#refmodel">reference map</a>
is reported in the <a href="../../UsersGuide/reply.html"><b>Reply Log</b></a>.
The first three columns of the matrix describe a rotation and the
fourth describes a translation (performed after the rotation).
The transformation is also described
as an axis of rotation (a unit vector), point on the axis,
degrees of rotation, and shift parallel to the axis.
</p>

<p>
<b>Comparing fits</b>.
Because local optima rather than a global optimum are found,
it is often beneficial to explore and compare different fits. 
This can be done by opening multiple copies of the 
<a href="#fitmodel">fit model</a> and 
fitting them from different starting positions.
The <a href="../../UsersGuide/modelpanel.html"><b>Model Panel</b></a>
can be used to hide and show individual copies.
Different positions of atomic coordinates can be compared with the command
<a href="../../UsersGuide/midas/rmsd.html"><b>rmsd</b></a>.
</p>

<p>
<b>Clipping and hiding are ignored.</b>
The calculation uses full maps even if 
partly hidden by clipping planes, zoning
(with <a href="../surfzone/surfzone.html"><b>Surface Zone</b></a>
or <a href="../volumeviewer/volumeviewer.html#zone">zoning</a> in
<a href="../../ContributedSoftware/volumeviewer/framevolumeviewer.html"
target="_top"><b>Volume Viewer</b></a>), or
<a href="../volumeviewer/volumeviewer.html#mouseselect">subregion
selection</a> in
<a href="../../ContributedSoftware/volumeviewer/framevolumeviewer.html"
target="_top"><b>Volume Viewer</b></a>.
</p>

<p>
<b>Self-correlation &ne; 1</b>.  
The correlation value
of a map with itself in the same position should equal 1.  
However, in such cases, <b>Fit in Map</b> can report values much less than
1 because of floating-point rounding errors in grid point positions. 
Grid points at the boundary of a map can be found to lie outside the map, 
yielding interpolated values of 0.
</p>

<p>
<b>Speed</b>.
Fitting 60,000 atoms using 76 steps takes about 15 seconds on a 2 GHz
PC system (circa 2005). The time taken is proportional to the number of
fit atoms or fit map grid points.
<a href="../../UsersGuide/selection.html">Selecting</a>
just the CA atoms of a protein will allow
substantially faster calculation than using all atoms.
The optimization calculation is written partly in C++ for speed 
and partly in Python.
