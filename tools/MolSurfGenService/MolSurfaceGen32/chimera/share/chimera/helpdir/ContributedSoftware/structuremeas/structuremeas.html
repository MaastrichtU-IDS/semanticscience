<h3>Structure Measurements</h3>
</a><p>
The <b>Structure Measurements</b> panel has four sections:
<ul>
<li><a href="#distances"><b>Distances</b></a> - monitor distances
<li><a href="#angles"><b>Angles/Torsions</b></a> 
- monitor angles and torsions
<li><a href="#adjust"><b>Adjust Torsions</b></a> - rotate bonds
<li><a href="#axes"><b>Axes/Planes</b></a> - show axes and planes based
on sets of atoms, perform related measurements
</ul>
Only one section is shown at a time, and clicking the tab for another
brings it to the front.  Each section is listed as a tool
in the <b>Structure Analysis</b> category.  Tools can be started in
<a href="../../UsersGuide/extension.html">several ways</a>.

<h3><a name="distances">Distances</a>
<img src="disticon.png" alt="icon"></h3>
<p>
The <b>Distances</b> section of
<a href="#structuremeas"><b>Structure Measurements</b></a>
is a table of distance monitors 
(measurements that update if there are changes).
Distance monitors are
saved in <a href="../../UsersGuide/sessions.html#sesdef">sessions</a>.
See also:
<a href="../../UsersGuide/midas/distance.html"><b>distance</b></a>
</p><p>
There are <a href="../../UsersGuide/extension.html">several ways to start</a>
<b>Distances</b>, a tool in the <b>Structure Analysis</b> category.
Distance monitors can be created in three ways:
<ul>
<li> The <b>Create</b> button
creates a distance monitor between two atoms that have been
<a href="../../UsersGuide/selection.html">selected</a> 
(exactly two atoms must be selected).
<li> <a href="../../UsersGuide/selection.html#pickselect">Picking</a> one
atom and
Shift-double-<a href="../../UsersGuide/selection.html#pickselect">picking</a>
the second atom (that is, doubleclicking it with the button
assigned to <a href="../../UsersGuide/selection.html#pickselect">picking</a>)
elicits a button marked <b>Show Distance</b>.
Clicking it creates the distance monitor
and leaves the atoms in a
<a href="../../UsersGuide/selection.html">selected</a> state.
Clicking elsewhere removes the button without creating a distance monitor
but leaves the atoms in a
<a href="../../UsersGuide/selection.html">selected</a> state.
<li> The command <a href="../../UsersGuide/midas/distance.html">
<b>distance</b></a> can also be used.
</ul>
<table border="1" align="left" style="margin:8px 8px 8px 8px">
<tr><th>Distances - <a name="listsimple">simple atom listings</a>
</th></tr>
<tr><td><img src="distpanel.png" alt="Distances"></td></tr>
</table>
The distance list can be sorted by the values in any column by
clicking the header.  Clicking the header once sorts the entries
in order of increasing value and places an up arrowhead (triangle)
in the header.  Clicking again sorts the entries in decreasing
order and places a down arrowhead (inverted triangle) in the header.
</p><p>
A distance monitor can be <b><i>chosen</i></b> by clicking on its line,
and more than one can be chosen at a time.
Chosen lines are highlighted in the dialog.
<b>Ctrl</b>-click toggles the status of a line, while clicking on the first 
(or last) line of a contiguous block and then <b>Shift</b>-clicking 
on the last (or first) chooses all of the lines in the block.
</p><p>
Choosing a distance listing
<a href="../../UsersGuide/selection.html">selects</a> the corresponding 
distance <a href="../../UsersGuide/pbpanel.html#pbdef">pseudobond</a>.
The <b>Choosing in table...</b> option allows additionally
<a href="../../UsersGuide/selection.html">selecting</a> 
the corresponding atoms.
<b>Remove</b> deletes the chosen distance monitors.
If there is only one, it is not necessary to choose it
before using <b>Remove</b>.
</p><p>
The <b>Labels</b> setting applies to all distance
monitors and can be switched among:
<ul>
<li><b>None</b> - no label
<li><b>ID</b> - distance monitor ID number (the first column in the listing)
<li><b>Distance</b> - the distance in angstroms
</ul>
The <b>Decimal places</b> and <b>Show Angstrom symbol</b> settings 
control how distances are reported in the table and 
(when <b>Labels</b> is set to <b>Distance</b>) in labels.
The <b>Decimal places</b> can be changed by clicking or holding down 
one of the arrows on either side of the value.
Of course, decimal places beyond those present in the input
coordinates are not very meaningful.
</p><p>
The lines drawn to represent distance monitors are
<a href="../../UsersGuide/pbpanel.html#pbdef">
pseudobonds</a> in a group named <b>distance monitor</b>.  
Clicking <b>Display options...</b> brings up a list of
<a href="../../UsersGuide/pbattrib.html#group">pseudobond attributes</a>
for this group, allowing changes in properties
such as color, linewidth, and whether the lines are dashed. 
When an individual 
<a href="../../UsersGuide/pbpanel.html#pbdef">pseudobond</a>
is <a href="../../UsersGuide/selection.html">selected</a>,
its attributes
can be altered with the <a href="../../UsersGuide/inspection.html">
<b>Selection Inspector</b></a>.
</p>

<h3><a name="angles">Angles/Torsions</a>
<img src="angicon.png" alt="icon"></h3>
<p>
The <b>Angles/Torsions</b> section of
<a href="#structuremeas"><b>Structure Measurements</b></a>
is a table of angle monitors (measurements that update if there are changes).
A "bond angle" is measured for three atoms and a "torsion angle" 
for four atoms; however, it is not necessary for
the atoms to be contiguous or even bonded to one another.
Angle monitors are
saved in <a href="../../UsersGuide/sessions.html#sesdef">sessions</a>.
</p><p>
<b>Angles/Torsions</b> reports changes but cannot be used to change the angles.
To modify torsions, use <a href="#adjust"><b>Adjust Torsions</b></a> instead.
</p><p>
There are <a href="../../UsersGuide/extension.html">several ways to start</a>
<b>Angles/Torsions</b>, a tool in the <b>Structure Analysis</b> category.
Angle monitors can be created in various ways:
<ul>
<li> The <b>Create</b> button
creates an angle monitor for atoms that have been
<a href="../../UsersGuide/selection.html">selected</a> (exactly
three or four atoms must be selected; a bond angle is measured when
three atoms are selected, a torsion angle when four atoms are selected).
<li> <a href="../../UsersGuide/selection.html#pickselect">Picking</a>
two atoms and then
Shift-double-<a href="../../UsersGuide/selection.html#pickselect">picking</a>
the third (that is, doubleclicking it with the button
assigned to <a href="../../UsersGuide/selection.html#pickselect">picking</a>)
elicits a button marked <b>Measure Angle</b>.
Clicking it creates a bond angle monitor and leaves the atoms in a
<a href="../../UsersGuide/selection.html">selected</a> state.
Clicking elsewhere removes the button without creating a monitor
but leaves the atoms in a
<a href="../../UsersGuide/selection.html">selected</a> state.
<li> <a href="../../UsersGuide/selection.html#pickselect">Picking</a>
three atoms and then
Shift-double-<a href="../../UsersGuide/selection.html#pickselect">picking</a>
the fourth (that is, doubleclicking it with the button
assigned to <a href="../../UsersGuide/selection.html#pickselect">picking</a>)
elicits a button marked <b>Measure Torsion</b>.
Clicking it creates a torsion angle monitor and leaves the atoms in a
<a href="../../UsersGuide/selection.html">selected</a> state.
Clicking elsewhere removes the button without creating a monitor
but leaves the atoms in a
<a href="../../UsersGuide/selection.html">selected</a> state.
</ul>
The angles/torsions list can be sorted by the values in any column by
clicking the header.  Clicking the header once sorts the entries
in order of increasing value and places an up arrowhead (triangle)
in the header.  Clicking again sorts the entries in decreasing
order and places a down arrowhead (inverted triangle) in the header.
</p><p>
A measurement in the list can be <b><i>chosen</i></b> by clicking on its line,
and more than one can be chosen at a time.
Chosen lines are highlighted in the dialog.
<b>Ctrl</b>-click toggles the status of a line, while clicking on the first 
(or last) line of a contiguous block and then <b>Shift</b>-clicking 
on the last (or first) chooses all of the lines in the block.
</p><p>
Choosing an angle monitor also
<a href="../../UsersGuide/selection.html">selects</a> the corresponding atoms 
and bonds when the <b>Choosing in table...</b> option is on.
<b>Remove</b> deletes the chosen measurement(s).
If there is only one measurement, it is not necessary to choose it
before clicking <b>Remove</b>.
</p><p>
The <b>Decimal places</b> setting controls how angles are reported
in the table; the number of digits shown after the decimal 
can be changed by clicking or holding down one of the arrows on 
either side of the value. 
</p><p>
The command <a href="../../UsersGuide/midas/angle.html"><b>angle</b></a>
can also be used to measure bond angles and torsions; however, it yields
a static measurement rather than a continuously updating monitor.
</p>

<h3><a name="adjust">Adjust Torsions</a>
<img src="torsicon.png" alt="icon"></h3>
<p>
The <b>Adjust Torsions</b> section of
<a href="#structuremeas"><b>Structure Measurements</b></a>
is a table of active (rotatable) torsions.
Active torsions are
saved in <a href="../../UsersGuide/sessions.html#sesdef">sessions</a>.
See also: <a href="../rotamers/framerot.html" 
target="_top"><b>Rotamers</b></a>,
<a href="../../UsersGuide/midas/rotation.html"><b>rotation</b></a>,
<a href="../../UsersGuide/midas/swapaa.html"><b>swapaa</b></a>
</p><p>
There are <a href="../../UsersGuide/extension.html">several ways to start</a>
<b>Adjust Torsions</b>, a tool in the <b>Structure Editing</b> category.
Torsions can be activated in several different ways:
<ul>
<li> The <b>Activate</b> button
activates a rotation around a bond that has been
<a href="../../UsersGuide/selection.html#pickselect">picked</a>
in the graphics window.
<li>Double-<a href="../../UsersGuide/selection.html#pickselect">picking</a>
a bond (that is, doubleclicking it with the button
assigned to <a href="../../UsersGuide/selection.html#pickselect">picking</a>)
elicits a menu with the option <b>Rotate Bond</b>.
Choosing this option activates the torsion,
opens <b>Adjust Torsions</b> (if it is not already open),
and leaves the bond in a
<a href="../../UsersGuide/selection.html">selected</a> state.
Clicking elsewhere removes the menu
without activating a torsion but leaves the bond in a
<a href="../../UsersGuide/selection.html">selected</a> state.
<li> The command <a href="../../UsersGuide/midas/rotation.html">
<b>rotation</b></a> can also be used.
</ul>
<table border="1" align="left" style="margin:8px 8px 8px 8px">
<tr><th>Adjust Torsions - <a name="listspec">command-line 
specifiers</a></th></tr>
<tr><td><img src="rotpanel.png" alt="Adjust Torsions"></td></tr>
</table>
An error message will appear
if an attempt is made to activate a bond that is
terminal (no additional atoms attached to one or both ends),
within a ring, or already rotatable.
</p><p>
If the four atoms defining a torsion are called 1-2-3-4,
1 is the <b>Near</b> atom and 4 is the <b>Far</b> atom,
which will move when the bond is rotated.
The angle in degrees as defined by the current <b>Near</b> and <b>Far</b>
atoms is shown in the <b>Torsion</b> column.
<a name="anglemode">
<b>Torsion</b> can be toggled to <b>Delta</b>;
</a>
the reported value is then
the angle in degrees relative to the starting angle,
and there are no <b>Near</b> and <b>Far</b> columns.
</p><p>
<img src="5a.png" alt="bond rotation example" align="right">
A bond can be rotated by entering a new angle value (and pressing return),
clicking the arrows flanking the angle value,
or manipulating the dial.  The <b>Dial size</b> can be set to 
<b>small</b>, <b>medium</b>, or <b>large</b>.  Further, torsions
can be manipulated in the graphics window with the mouse.
This can be done by checking
<a name="withmouse"><b>Rotate [<i>torsion</i>] using [<i>button</i>]</b></a>
and choosing the desired torsion and mouse button from the pulldown menus.
</p><p>
The <b>Bond</b> column contains a pulldown menu for each active rotation,
labeled with identifiers for atoms 2->3 (those flanking the rotatable bond):
<ul>
<li><b>Revert</b> - restore the original torsion angle
<li><b>Reverse</b> - change which side of the torsion moves when the bond
is rotated (change the torsion definition from A-B-C-D to D-C-B-A)
<li><b>Deactivate</b>
 - deactivate the bond rotation and remove it from the table.
Note that the torsion will not automatically revert to its original value when
deactivated; <b>Revert</b> should be used before <b>Deactivate</b> to retain
the original torsional angle.  Even if the same rotation is reactivated later,
<b>Revert</b> will not work to restore the angle, since the original value
has not been saved.
<li><b>Select</b> - <a href="../../UsersGuide/selection.html">select</a>
the rotatable bond and deselect any others;
when in the <a href="#anglemode"><b>Torsion</b> mode</a>, also
<a href="../../UsersGuide/selection.html">select</a>
the two flanking bonds (to show all four atoms defining the torsion).
</ul>
</p><p>
When atom 2 is bonded to more than two atoms, there is more than one
possible <b>Near</b> atom, and alternatives (if any) are available
in a pulldown menu from the current <b>Near</b> atom name.  Likewise,
when atom 3 is bonded to more than two atoms, there is more than one
possible <b>Far</b> atom, and alternatives (if any) are available
in a pulldown menu from the current <b>Far</b> atom name.
For the first torsion in the example (figures above), there are two choices 
for the <b>Near</b> atom, <b>C8</b> and <b>C4</b>, and two choices for
the <b>Far</b> atom, <b>O4'</b> and <b>C2'</b>.  For the second torsion,
there are two choices for the <b>Near</b> atom, <b>O4'</b> and <b>C3'</b>,
and only one possible <b>Far</b> atom, <b>O5'</b>.  Of course, if
<b>Reverse</b> is used, the <b>Near</b> and <b>Far</b> choices are
interchanged, and in the <a href="#anglemode"><b>Delta</b> mode</a>,
there are no <b>Near</b> and <b>Far</b> columns.
</p><p>
The <b>Labels</b> setting applies to all active torsions
and can be switched among:
<ul>
<li><b>None</b> - no label
<li><b>ID</b> - torsion ID number (the first column in the listing)
<li><b>Name</b> - identifiers for atoms 2->3 
(as shown in the <b>Bond</b> column)
<li><b>Angle</b> - the angle in degrees
</ul>
The <b>Decimal places</b> and <b>Show degree symbol</b> settings 
control how angle values are displayed 
when <b>Labels</b> is set to <b>Angle</b>.
The <b>Decimal places</b> can be changed by clicking or holding down 
one of the arrows on either side of the value.
</p>

<h3><a name="axes">Axes/Planes</a>
<img src="axesicon.png" alt="icon"></h3>
<p>
The <b>Axes/Planes</b> section of
<a href="#structuremeas"><b>Structure Measurements</b></a>
allows defining geometric objects (axes, planes) based on sets of atoms
and performing measurements involving the objects.
Axes are displayed as rods, planes as disks.  
Objects to be listed in the <a href="#objectlist"><b>Axes/Planes</b> table</a>
can also be created with the command
<a href="../../UsersGuide/midas/define.html"><b>define</b></a>.
<b>Axes/Planes</b> displays and information are
saved in <a href="../../UsersGuide/sessions.html#sesdef">sessions</a>.
See also:
<a href="../../UsersGuide/midas/distance.html"><b>distance</b></a>,

<a href="../../UsersGuide/midas/measure.html#inertia"><b>measure inertia</b></a>
</p><p>
There are <a href="../../UsersGuide/extension.html">several ways to start</a>
<b>Axes/Planes</b>, a tool in the <b>Structure Analysis</b> category.
</p><p>
<a name="define-axes">
Clicking <b>Define axes...</b> opens a dialog for specifying atom sets and
other axis parameters</a>:
<ul>
<li><b>Each helix in</b> [<i>models</i>]
- define an axis for each peptide/protein helix in the molecule model(s)
chosen in the list.  Peptide/protein helix assignments 
are taken from the input structure file or generated with 
<a href="../../UsersGuide/midas/ksdssp.html"><b>ksdssp</b></a>.
Only the backbone atoms N, CA, C are used to define the axes.
Sometimes two helices are adjacent in sequence (not separated by any
other residues), and the integer-valued residue attribute <b>ssId</b> is 
used to distinguish them.  Although such cases are detected automatically,
<b>ssId</b> can also be set manually with
<a href="../../UsersGuide/midas/setattr.html"><b>setattr</b></a>.
<br><br>
<li><b>Selected atoms (axis name [<i>name</i>])</b>
- define a single axis named <i>name</i> using all
<a href="../../UsersGuide/selection.html">selected</a> atoms
<br><br>
<li><b>Axis Parameters</b>:
  <ul>
  <li><b>Mass weighting</b> (only available for the <b>Selected atoms</b>
  option) - calculate inertial axis by mass-weighting the atoms;
  cannot be combined with <b>helical correction</b>
  <li><b>Use helical correction</b> - adjust axis orientation 
  to reduce the spread of atom-axis distances; cannot be combined with 
  <b>mass weighting</b>.
An axis is anchored at the the geometric center (centroid) of the defining
atomic coordinates and is initially aligned with the principal component of 
the coordinates.  While usually small,
helical correction improves results for short helices.
  <li><a name="replace"><b>Replace existing axes</b></a>
  - whether to remove any/all pre-existing axis displays when creating new ones
  <li><b>Color</b> (a
  <a href="../../UsersGuide/coloring.html#colorwell">color well</a>,
  default <b>No Color</b>, meaning to match the structure as much as possible)
  <li><b>Radius</b>
    <ul>
    <li> <b>average axis-atom distance</b> (default)
    <li> <b>angstroms</b> (a constant value, default <b>1.0</b> &Aring;)
    </ul>
  </ul>
</ul>
Only one <a href="../../UsersGuide/coloring.html#colorwell">color well</a>
setting and one constant radius value can be specified at a time.
However, the color of an axis can be changed later by clicking its
<a href="../../UsersGuide/coloring.html#colorwell">color well</a>
in the <a href="#objectlist">table of objects</a> and using the
<a href="../../UsersGuide/colortool.html"><b>Color Editor</b></a>, and
axes with different specified colors and radii can be created in 
successive stages when
<a href="#replace"><b>Replace existing axes</b></a> is turned off.
Clicking <b>Apply</b> (or <b>OK</b>, which also closes the
dialog) calculates the axes, adds them to the <a href="#objectlist">table</a>, 
and generates the corresponding displays.
</p><p>
<a name="define-plane">
Clicking <b>Define plane...</b> opens a dialog for defining a plane</a> 
based on the <a href="../../UsersGuide/selection.html">selected</a> atoms:
<ul>
<li><b>Plane name</b>
<li><a name="replaceplane"><b>Replace existing planes</b></a>
- whether to remove any/all pre-existing plane displays when creating new ones
<li><b>Color</b> (a
<a href="../../UsersGuide/coloring.html#colorwell">color well</a>,
default <b>No Color</b>, meaning to match the source atoms as much as possible)
<li><b>Set disk size to enclose atom projections</b>
(<b>true</b>/false) - whether the disk radius should be set
to span the projections of the defining atoms back onto the plane.
If true, an <b>Extra radius (padding)</b> can be specified
(default <b>0.0</b> &Aring;).  If false, 
a <b>Fixed radius</b> can be specified (default <b>10.0</b> &Aring;).
The disk center is the non-mass-weighted centroid of the atoms.
<li><b>Disk thickness</b> (default <b>0.1</b> &Aring;)
</ul>
Clicking <b>Apply</b> (or <b>OK</b>, which also closes the
dialog) calculates a plane
based on the <a href="../../UsersGuide/selection.html">selected</a> atoms,
adds it to the <a href="#objectlist">table</a>, 
and generates the corresponding display.
</p>
<table border="1" align="right" style="margin:8px 8px 8px 8px">

<li><b>Length</b> - axis length,
end-to-end distance needed to span the projections of 
the defining atoms back onto the axis
<li><b>Radius</b> - axis or plane radius
</ul>
The table can be sorted by a column by clicking the column header.
</p><p>
An object can be <b><i>chosen</i></b> by clicking on its line,
and more than one can be chosen at a time.
Chosen lines are highlighted in the dialog.
<b>Ctrl</b>-click toggles the status of a line, while clicking on the first 
(or last) line of a contiguous block and then <b>Shift</b>-clicking 
on the last (or first) chooses all of the lines in the block.
</p><p>
Choosing any two objects reports their applicable geometric relationships
below the table and in the
<a href="../../UsersGuide/reply.html"><b>Reply Log</b></a>.
For angle measurements, axes and planes are treated as infinite.
For distance measurements, axes are treated as finite line segments, while
planes are treated as infinite.
Optionally, choosing objects also: 
<ul>
<li><b>selects object</b> - <a href="../../UsersGuide/selection.html">selects</a>
each object (currently nothing can be done to such a selection, but the objects
are highlighted in the graphics window)
<li><b>selects atoms</b> - <a href="../../UsersGuide/selection.html">selects</a>
the atoms used to define each object
</ul>
Conversely, <a href="../../UsersGuide/selection.html#pickselect">picking</a>
an object from the screen will choose it in the table.
</p><p>
Clicking <b>Delete</b> removes the chosen objects.  
In addition, closing a molecule model or deleting atoms 
removes any objects defined using those atoms.
<b>Rename</b> allows changing the names of the chosen objects; 
this will change their order in the table if sorting is currently by name.
<b>Report distance</b> measures distances between the chosen objects
and <a href="../../UsersGuide/selection.html">selected</a> atoms;
results are sent to the
<a href="../../UsersGuide/reply.html"><b>Reply Log</b></a>.
If a single atom is selected, the distance to each chosen object is reported;
if multiple atoms are selected, the minimum, maximum, and mean distances
are reported.
