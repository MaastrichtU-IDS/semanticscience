<h3>Residue Letter Coloring</h3>
<p>
The <b>Clustal X</b> coloring scheme in
<a href="framemav.html" target="_top"><b>Multalign Viewer</b></a>
depends on both residue type and the pattern of conservation within a column. 
The Clustal X scheme is described in the color parameter file
<a href="colprot.par">colprot.par</a>.
This scheme is encoded in Chimera and cannot be changed by users. 
<p><p>
However, arbitrary color schemes 
can be defined using the same <a href="#format">file format</a> and loaded with 
<a href="multalignviewer.html#mavmenu-tools"><b>Tools... 
Load Color Scheme</b></a> in the <b>Multalign Viewer</b> menu.
When a scheme is loaded, the residue codes are colored accordingly
and the name of the custom coloring file is added to the list of
choices for <a href="multalignviewer.html#coloring"><b>Residue 
letter coloring</b></a> in the 
<a href="multalignviewer.html#mavpref-analysis"><b>Analysis</b> preferences</a>.
The <a href="../../UsersGuide/opensave.html">dialog</a> for loading the
file includes an option to <b>Make this scheme the default</b>.
The location of each custom coloring file is saved in the
<a href="../../UsersGuide/preferences.html#preffile">
<b>preferences</b> file</a>.  If a custom coloring file is later
renamed, moved, or deleted, trying to load the corresponding scheme
will generate an error.

<h3>Color Parameter File Format</h3></a>
<p>
<b>Multalign Viewer</b> uses the same format of color parameter
file as the program Clustal X.  Examples:
<ul>
<li> <a href="colprot.par" type="text/plain">colprot.par</a>
(describes Clustal X residue letter coloring)
<li> <a href="custom.par" type="text/plain">custom.par</a>
(an example of custom coloring; matches the protein structure
coloring done with the Chimera command file  
<a href="../defineattrib/rescol.com" type="text/plain">rescol.com</a>)
</ul>
Such files have three sections:  
<ol>
<li>Colors are defined in the optional <b>@rgbindex</b> section.  
If the section is present, it must include all of the colors 
used in the file. Each line in this section consists of a color name
and the red, green, and blue components of the color, for example:
<pre>
GREEN        0.1 0.8 0.1
</pre>
The color names are relevant only to the rules within the file; 
for example, GREEN as defined in this file 
cannot be accessed by Chimera users and can differ from the color
named green in Chimera.
<br><br>
<li>The <b>@consensus</b> section assigns single-character symbols to
column consensus conditions.  The symbols can be uppercase or 
lowercase letters, which should not be confused with the single-letter
residue codes (although they are sometimes the same for mnemonic reasons).
For example,
<pre>
+ = 60% k:r
</pre> 
means that "+" symbolizes the case where lysine and arginine
together comprise at least 60% of the column of aligned amino acids, and
<pre>
n = 50% n
N = 85% n
</pre>
means that "n" symbolizes the case where asparagine comprises
at least 50% of the column and "N" symbolizes the
case where asparagine comprises at least 85% of the column.
<br><br>
<li>The <b>@color</b> section then assigns colors to particular 
residues under particular consensus conditions.
Thus,
<pre>
n = GREEN if n:N:D
</pre>
means that an asparagine in the alignment (which could be shown with n or N)
should be colored GREEN if any of the conditions n, N, or D apply to
the column in which it resides.  When none of the conditions apply, the
residue is colored black.
</ol>
The color parameter file format is described in detail in the
<a href="http://www.es.embnet.org/Doc/clustalw/clustalx.html#Colors"
target="_top"><b>Colors</b> section</a> of the Clustal X manual.
