<h3>FindHBond
<img src="findhbond.png" alt="FindHBond icon"></h3>
<p>
<b>FindHBond</b> uses <a href="../../UsersGuide/idatm.html">atom types</a>
and <a href="#criteria">geometric criteria</a> to identify possible
hydrogen bonds (H-bonds).  It is not necessary for hydrogen atoms 
to be present.  All potential H-bonding interactions fulfilling the 
criteria are shown.  For example, even if it is not possible for
a particular hydroxyl group to donate a hydrogen bond to two particular
acceptors <i>simultaneously</i>, both possibilities will be displayed if the
hydroxyl lacks an explicit hydrogen atom.
If the hydroxyl group has an explicit hydrogen atom,
however, only H-bonds compatible with the position
of the hydrogen will be found.

<b>FindHBond</b>, a tool in the <b>Structure Analysis</b>
and <b>Surface/Binding Analysis</b> categories.

</p><p>
<a name="scope">
The scope of the calculation</a> is controlled under
<b>Find these bonds:</b>
<ul>
<li><b>inter-model</b> - between models only
<li><b>intra-model</b> - within models only 
<li><b>both</b> (default)
</ul>
Regardless of the scope, the calculation will not include interactions between 
different <a href="../../UsersGuide/modelpanel.html#multimodel">submodels</a>
of the same model (although this can be done with the
<a href="../../UsersGuide/midas/hbonds.html"><b>hbonds</b></a> command).
The calculation can be further restricted with the options:
<ul>
<li><b>Restrict to models...</b>
show a list of molecule models from which one or more can be chosen.
Individual models or blocks of models can be chosen with the left mouse
button.  Ctrl-click toggles the status of an individual model.
To choose a block of models without dragging,
click on the first (or last) and then Shift-click 
on the last (or first) in the desired block.
<li><b>Only find H-bonds with
[at least one end / exactly one end / both ends] selected</b> - 
report only H-bonds with donor and/or acceptor heavy atoms
within the current <a href="../../UsersGuide/selection.html">selection</a>
</ul>
<a name="parameters">
The H-bonds found will be displayed</a> as 
<a href="../../UsersGuide/pbpanel.html#pbdef">pseudobonds</a>
of the specified <b>H-bond color</b> and <b>Line width</b>
connecting the donor and acceptor atoms.
Color settings can be changed by clicking the adjacent
<a href="../../UsersGuide/coloring.html#colorwell">color wells</a>.
If the donor and acceptor atoms are subsequently moved relative to each
other, the pseudobonds will "stretch" rather than disappearing, even
if the atoms no longer meet the criteria for hydrogen bonding. 
The pseudobonds representing H-bonds can be removed with the command 
<a href="../../UsersGuide/midas/hbonds.html"><b>~hbonds</b></a>.
The <a href="../../UsersGuide/pbpanel.html"><b>PseudoBond Panel</b></a>
can also be used to close the pseudobond group
(named <b>hydrogen bonds</b>) or alter its display.
</p><p>
<a name="tolerances">
<b>Relax H-bond constraints</b></a> indicates that tolerances to
<b>Relax constraints by</b> should be applied to the precise
<a href="#criteria">geometric criteria</a>. 
These criteria come from a survey of high-resolution small molecule structures; 
empirically, tolerances of <b>0.4 angstroms</b> and <b>20.0 degrees</b>
work well for most macromolecular structures.
H-bonds within the tolerances but that do not meet the
precise criteria can be colored differently than the H-bonds
that meet the precise criteria.
</p><p>
Additional options:
<ul>
<li><b>If endpoint atom hidden, show endpoint residue</b> -
turn on the display of residues containing an
H-bonding atom if that atom is not displayed initially
(By default, if the atom on either end of a
<a href="../../UsersGuide/pbpanel.html#pbdef">pseudobond</a> representing
an H-bond is not shown, the pseudobond itself is not shown, although
it still exists; displaying the atom allows the H-bond to be shown.)
<li><b>Retain currently displayed H-bonds</b> -
retain a previously determined set of H-bonds through
a subsequent round of H-bond detection
<li><b>Write information to file</b>
- write H-bond information (atom specifications and distances) to a file.
The <a href="../../UsersGuide/opensave.html">dialog</a> for saving the file
includes a <b>Naming style</b> option to control 
<a href="../../UsersGuide/preferences.html#namingstyle">how atoms 
will be specified</a>.
<li><b>Write information to reply log</b> 
- write H-bond information (atom specifications and distances)
to the <a href="../../UsersGuide/reply.html"><b>Reply Log</b></a>. 
<b>Atomspec display style</b> in the

<a name="criteria">
<h4>METHOD AND CRITERIA</h4></a>
<p>
The geometric criteria are based on a survey of small molecule
crystal structures, as described in
<blockquote>
<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9007693" target="_blank">
Three-dimensional hydrogen-bond geometry and probability information 
from a crystal survey.</a>
Mills JE, Dean PM.
<i>J Comput Aided Mol Des.</i> 1996 Dec;10(6):607-22.
</blockquote>
There are many different sets of geometric
criteria, corresponding to the many different donor-acceptor combinations
(see Tables 5-8 in the reference).
There is an upper bound on distance and one or more
angular range criteria for each category of H-bond.
It is generally useful to relax the criteria since most structures
are not as high-resolution as those used in the survey.
User-specified <a href="#tolerances">tolerances</a> 
are added to each criterion's upper bound and/or subtracted from
its lower bound (depending on the particular criterion).
</p><p>
Chimera uses atom and residue names, or if these are not "standard,"
the coordinates of atoms, to determine connectivity and
<a href="../../UsersGuide/idatm.html">atom types</a>,
which in turn determine which geometric criteria are appropriate for
detecting a hydrogen bond between specific atoms.
Possible donor groups are hydrogen-bearing nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur atoms,
and possible acceptor groups are nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur atoms
with a lone pair.  H-bonds involving other types of atoms are not considered.
Not all of the possible donor-acceptor combinations were listed
in the Mills and Dean parameter tables; some categories of sulfur
were not surveyed, and several combinations of the surveyed types
were not observed frequently enough to collect good statistics on their
geometries.  In such cases, <b>FindHbond</b>
applies estimated H-bond criteria.
</p><p>
When there are no explicit hydrogens on a potential donor atom, 
<b>FindHBond</b> will use the donor 
<a href="../../UsersGuide/idatm.html">atom type</a>
to infer their presence.
For functional groups where the hydrogen
positions are well-determined by the positions of the nonhydrogen atoms,
the H-bonds detected in the presence and absence of explicit hydrogen
atoms should be virtually identical.  For functional groups where the
hydrogen position is not well-determined (such as rotatable hydroxyls),
the presence of an explicit hydrogen atom will limit the detected
H-bonds to those appropriate for the observed position, instead of
all of its possible positions.
