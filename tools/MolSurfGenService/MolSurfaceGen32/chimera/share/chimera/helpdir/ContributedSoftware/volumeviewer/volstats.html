<h3>Volume Mean, SD, RMS <img src="volstatsicon.png" 
alt="Volume Mean, SD, RMS icon"></h3>
<p>
<b>Volume Mean, SD, RMS</b> calculates statistics for the
<a href="volumeviewer.html#currentset">current set</a> of data
in <a href="framevolumeviewer.html" target="_top"><b>Volume Viewer</b></a>.
</p><p>
There are <a href="../../UsersGuide/extension.html">several ways to call</a>
<b>Volume Mean, SD, RMS</b>, a tool in the <b>Volume Data</b> category
(including from the
<a href="framevolumeviewer.html" target="_top"><b>Volume Viewer</b></a>
<b>Tools</b> menu).
</p><p>
Calling the tool calculates the mean, the standard deviation (SD) 
from the mean, and the root-mean-square (RMS) deviation from zero for the
<a href="volumeviewer.html#currentset">current set</a> of data
and reports the results in the
<a href="../../UsersGuide/reply.html"><b>Reply Log</b></a>.
Only data for the current 
<a href="volumeviewer.html#subregiondef">subregion</a>
and <a href="volumeviewer.html#datastep">step size</a> are used. 
SD and RMS are both root-mean-square deviations, 
but the SD is calculated relative to the average value (mean)
whereas the RMS is calculated relative to zero.
