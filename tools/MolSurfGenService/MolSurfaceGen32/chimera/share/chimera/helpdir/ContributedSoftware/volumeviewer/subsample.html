<h3>Volume Viewer - precomputed subsamples</h3>
<p>
The use of
<a href="volumeviewer.html#precomputed">precomputed subsamples</a>
in <a href="framevolumeviewer.html" target="_top"><b>Volume Viewer</b></a>
decreases memory usage and time spent reading files.
</p><p>
The <a href="volumeviewer.html#datastep"><b>Step</b></a>
values (<a href="volumeviewer.html#cellsizes">cell sizes</a>) 
used to generate a subsample are inferred by comparing the numbers of
data points in the full data set and in the subsample.
For each dimension,
valid cell sizes S for full data size N and subsample size M satisfy
(M-1)S < N < (M+1)S.  If there are no valid cell sizes, the subsample
file will not be accepted, and a warning message will be issued.
If there is more than one valid cell size, the user is queried.
Examples:
<ul>
<li> If the full data set is (100,100,100) and the subsample is
(33,33,33) or (34,34,34), the inferred <b>Step</b> values are (3,3,3).
If the subsample is (32,32,32), a warning message will be issued. 
<li> If the full data set is (20,20,20) and the subsample is (3,3,3),
possible <b>Step</b> values in each dimension are 6, 7, 8, and 9.
The user will be asked to specify the correct <b>Step</b> values.
</ul>
</p><p>
The target <b>Step</b> values are shown in the
<a href="volumeviewer.html#datastep"><b>Data and Step menus</b> section</a> 
of <a href="framevolumeviewer.html" target="_top"><b>Volume Viewer</b></a>.
If a subsample is inferred to have been generated
with these same values, it will be used.  If not,
then another subsample that includes the desired subsample
will be sought and used, if possible.  For example, if a (2,2,4) subsampling
is the target but does not exist, an existing (2,2,2) subsampling can
be used to generate it.  A (2,2,3) subsampling could not be used in this
situation.  If no suitable subsample is available, the full data will be used.
