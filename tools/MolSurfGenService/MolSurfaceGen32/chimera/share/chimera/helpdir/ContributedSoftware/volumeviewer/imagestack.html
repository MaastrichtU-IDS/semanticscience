<h2>Image Stacks</h2>
<p>
An image stack is a series of 2D images that can be stacked to generate a 
set of <a href="../../UsersGuide/filetypes.html#volume">volume data</a>.
An image stack can be opened by simply choosing multiple image files
in the general <a href="../../UsersGuide/opensave.html#opendialog"><b>Open 
File</b> dialog</a> or the similar dialog called from
<a href="framevolumeviewer.html" target="_top"><b>Volume Viewer</b></a>.
Alternatively, a single multipage image file can be read as a stack.
When multiple files are chosen, only the first page of any multipage 
image file will be included in the stack.
</p><p>
Possible formats are those supported by
<a href="http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/" target="_blank">PIL</a>
and are indicated by standard filename suffixes
(.tif, .tiff, .png, <i>etc.</i>).
</p><p>
Images must be grayscale; color images are not accepted.
8-bit unsigned integer, 16-bit unsigned integer, 32-bit signed integer, 
or 32-bit float pixel values can be read.
