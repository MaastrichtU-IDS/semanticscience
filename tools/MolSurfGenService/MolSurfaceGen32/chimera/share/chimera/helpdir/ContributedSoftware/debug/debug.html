<p>
<b>Debug Graphics Driver</b> allows selectively disabling OpenGL features
to identify workarounds for graphics driver bugs.  
It is not intended for tuning performance in the absence of such problems, 
as changing the settings from the system defaults
generally reduces responsiveness or visual quality.
</p><p>
Reasons to suspect graphics driver bugs include unknown C++ exceptions,
error messages mentioning any of the features listed in the dialog at right,
visual artifacts such as streaks, very slow response time, 
crashes, or even failure to start up 
(<a href="http://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/graphics/graphicsbugs.html"
target="_blank">more...</a>).  
</p><p>
<a name="debugmode">
<b>Debug Graphics Driver</b> can be called</a> at the time of Chimera startup:
<ul>
<li>on Windows, using the Windows Start menu entry <b>UCSF Chimera / Chimera
Debug OpenGL</b>
<li>on other platforms, 
<a href="../../UsersGuide/startup.html">starting Chimera</a> from the
system command line (Terminal on Macs) with the option
<a href="../../UsersGuide/options.html#debug-opengl"><b>--debug-opengl</b></a>
</ul>
Showing <b>Debug Graphics Driver</b> at startup can also be specified in the
<a href="../../UsersGuide/preferences.html#General"><b>General</b> 
preferences</a>.
</p><p>
Grayed-out options are those reported by the system as unavailable.
<b>Disable all</b> unchecks all of the options.
<b>Factory Defaults</b> populates the dialog with the system defaults.
</p><p>
Clicking <b>Save</b> saves the current settings 
(if different from the factory defaults)
in a file named <b>gfxinfo.sav</b> in subdirectory <b>.chimera</b> 
of the user's home directory
(on Windows, this depends on a user's profile but is often
<b>C:\Documents and Settings\<i>username</i>\Application Data\</b>).
Saving the factory defaults simply removes the file if it exists.
Subsequent uses of Chimera will employ the saved settings.
<b>Revert to Saved</b>
populates the dialog with settings from the previously saved file.
</p><p>
<b>Start Chimera</b> starts Chimera with the current settings
(without saving them) and dismisses the dialog.
<b>Help</b> opens this manual page in a browser window.
</p><p>
When exiting Chimera with settings not yet saved,
the user will be asked whether the settings should be saved.  
If yes, <b>gfxinfo.sav</b> 
will be written as described above, and another dialog will appear
asking whether the configuration should be reported to the
Chimera developers.  Users will be asked about reporting 
the configuration whenever exiting a Chimera session
in which <b>Debug Graphics Driver</b> was initially shown and
saved settings were being used.
Presumably this mechanism will be used to share settings
that successfully alleviate some graphics problem on a particular system.
If yes, the process is the same as for bug submission, except
the form will be filled in automatically with the
saved graphics configuration along with other system information.
Including contact information and a description of the problems
that were alleviated is optional but encouraged.  
The report can also be canceled at that stage.
