<p>
The <b>Crystal Contacts</b> tool checks for clashes 
between copies of a structure when they are positioned 
according to symmetry information in the header of the PDB file.  
This tool was created to validate symmetry information for 
virus capsid structures in the 
<a href="http://www.rcsb.org" target="_blank">Protein Data Bank</a>.

<a href="../unitcell/unitcell.html"><b>Unit Cell</b></a>,

</p><p>
There are <a href="../../UsersGuide/extension.html">several ways to start</a>
<b>Crystal Contacts</b>, a tool in the <b>Higher-Order Structure</b> category.
It is also implemented as the command <a 
href="../../UsersGuide/midas/crystalcontacts.html"><b>crystalcontacts</b></a>.
</p><p>
The <b>Molecule</b> (presumably read from a PDB file with symmetry information)
should be chosen from the list of open molecule models.  
Clicking <b>Show Contacts</b> checks for atomic contacts
within the specified <b>Contact distance</b> between copies.
</p><p>
The results are shown schematically.
Each copy of the original structure is shown as a ball, and close contacts 
between copies are shown as cylinders connecting the balls:
  <ul>
  <li> <b>green balls</b> = the original structure and 
  copies related by noncrystallographic symmetry
  <li> <b>blue balls</b> = copies related by crystallographic symmetry, 
   together with the green balls representing one unit cell
  <li> <b>yellow balls</b> = copies from neighboring unit cells
  <li> <b>red cylinders</b> = close contacts
  </ul>
More specifically,
<ul>
<li>CRYST1 information is used to draw a unit cell box 
with one corner at (0,0,0).
<br><br>
<li>The structure in the PDB file is represented as a single green ball,
even if it includes multiple chains.
<br><br>
<li>MTRIX records are used to generate copies related by noncrystallographic 
symmetry, also shown in green; the green balls collectively
represent one <b><i>crystal asymmetric unit (CAU)</b></i>.  
If there are no MTRIX records, the starting structure is already the
CAU and only one green ball will be shown (example: PDB entry <b>1bzm</b>).
Icosahedral capsid structures typically contain a fraction of the CAU, a
<b><i>noncrystallographic symmetry (NCS) asymmetric unit</i></b>
that must be duplicated according to MTRIX records to generate the CAU
(example: PDB entry <b>1v9u</b>).  
Each ball represents a single NCS asymmetric unit.
<br><br>
<li>CRYST1 or SMTRY records are used to generate copies
related by crystallographic symmetry, shown in blue; 
the blue and green balls together represent 
the contents of one <b><i>crystal unit cell</b></i>.
<br><br>
<li>Copies with any atom within the <b>Contact distance</b> of a copy 
shown in green are identified.  A red cylinder with radius proportional to
the number of contacting atoms is drawn to represent the contact; 
the minimum and maximum cylinder radii are limited, with the minimum 
corresponding to 1% of atoms in contact and maximum corresponding to 5%.  
Copies in neighboring unit cells are shown as yellow balls 
if any of them form close contacts with a copy shown in green.
Copies right on top of each other are shown with a transparent green ball
rather than a connecting cylinder.
<br><br>
<li>The balls and box are created as a
<a href="../volumepathtracer/framevolpath.html" target="_top">marker set</a> 
and opened as a separate model.
</ul>
The <b>Create copies of contacting molecules</b> option indicates whether to
load the full atomic coordinates of any contacting copies when <b>Show
Contacts</b> is pressed.
</p><p>
Information on the contacts is listed in the 
<a href="../../UsersGuide/reply.html"><b>Reply Log</b></a>:
<p>
Each line reports a pair of contacting NCS asymmetric units. 
While low numbers of contacting <b>Atoms</b> are fairly common, 
very high numbers (especially complete overlap of the structures) 
indicate there may be an error in the symmetry information.
An index <b>MTRIXref</b> tells which MTRIX record positions one subunit, and
indices <b>MTRIX</b>, <b>SMTRY</b>, and <b>Unit Cell</b> identify the other.
The MTRIX and SMTRY matrix indices start at 0,
and therefore do not exactly match the matrix numbers given in the PDB header.
</p><p>
Each unique relative orientation of contacting NCS asymmetric units is 
reported, and the number of occurrences of geometrically equivalent pairs 
with the same contacts is given in the <b>Copies</b> column of the table. 
Because of round-off errors in computing symmetry matrices, 
tolerances of 0.1 degrees and 0.1 &Aring; are used 
to identify equivalent relative orientations.
