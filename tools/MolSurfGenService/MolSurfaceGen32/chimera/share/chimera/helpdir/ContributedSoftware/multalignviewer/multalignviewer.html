<b>Multalign Viewer</b> shows amino acid and nucleotide sequences:
<ul>
<li>multiple sequence alignments
  <ul>
  <li>read from files
(<a href="../../UsersGuide/filetypes.html#alignment">several formats</a>)
  <li>created by other tools in Chimera
(<a href="../matchmaker/matchmaker.html"><b>MatchMaker</b></a>,

  <li>of structures in Chimera (when started as <b>Sequence</b>)
  </ul>
</ul>
The sequences are automatically <a href="#association">associated</a>
with structures in Chimera.  Associated structures are not required,
but when they are present, selecting in the sequence with the mouse

the structures can be matched based on the sequence alignment, and so on.
Measures of sequence conservation and spatial variability can be shown
as <a href="#headers">headers</a> above the sequences.

<h4>STARTUP AND INPUT</h4></a>
<p>
There are <a href="../../UsersGuide/extension.html">several ways to start</a>
<b>Multalign Viewer</b>, a tool in the <b>Sequence</b> category.
Explicitly starting <b>Multalign Viewer</b> brings up a
<a href="../../UsersGuide/opensave.html">dialog</a> for opening a
<a href="../../UsersGuide/filetypes.html#alignment">sequence alignment</a>.
In fact, simply <a href="../../UsersGuide/filetypes.html">opening</a>
a file in any of the registered 
<a href="../../UsersGuide/filetypes.html#alignment">sequence alignment 
formats</a> (without starting <b>Multalign Viewer</b> first) 
will automatically use it to show the alignment.
Several alignments can be open at the same time, each in a
separate <a href="#seqwindow">sequence window</a>.
</p><p>
<a name="individual">
Individual sequences of structures in Chimera</a> can be shown:
<ul>
<li>by <a href="../../UsersGuide/extension.html">starting</a> 
the <b>Sequence</b> tool (<b>Sequence</b> category) 
<li>by choosing one or more molecule models in the left
side of the <a href="../../UsersGuide/modelpanel.html"><b>Model Panel</b></a> 
and clicking the <b>sequence...</b> button in the right side of the panel
</ul>
If there is more than one bonded multiresidue chain in the model(s), the chains 
will be listed in a dialog for designating which sequences to <b>Show</b>.  
The sequence of each chosen chain will be shown in a separate
<a href="#seqwindow">window</a>, including any residues not in
the structure itself but in SEQRES records in the input structure file.
Residues with standard names are assigned the corresponding standard
one-letter codes, while certain nonstandard residues are assigned the
same one-letter codes as closely related standard residues:
<ul>
<li> ASH (protonated ASP) = D
<li> CYX (disulfide-bonded CYS) = C
<li> GLH (protonated GLU) = E
<li> HID/HIE/HIP (different protonation states of HIS) = H
<li> HYP (hydroxyproline) = P
<li> MSE (selenomethionine) = M
<li> +N (methylated nucleic acid) = N, where N = A/C/G/T/U
<li> additional relationships described in MODRES records in PDB input files
</ul>
</p>

<a name="seqwindow">
<h4>THE SEQUENCE WINDOW</h4></a>

<table border="1" align="right" style="margin:8px 8px 8px 8px"
cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr><td> <img src="multal.png"> </td></tr>
</table>
<p>
The figure shows part of the sequence window contents for the input
file <a href="apoex.fa">apoex.fa</a>. 
In addition to sequences and their names, 
<a href="#numbering">numbering</a> and <a href="#headers">header lines</a>
may be displayed.  Font size, sequence wrapping behavior, and
the coloring of residue one-letter codes can be
controlled in the <a href="#mavpref-layout"><b>Appearance</b> preferences</a>.
Boxes enclosing one or more residues are called
<a href="#regions">alignment regions</a>.  One can
<a name="seqsearch">
search for occurrences of a particular string or pattern of residues
</a>
in one or all of the sequences using
<a href="#findsub"><b>Edit... Find Subsequence</b></a> or
<a href="#findpro"><b>Edit... Find PROSITE Pattern</b></a>
in the <b>Multalign Viewer</b> menu.
</p><p>
When the mouse focus is in the sequence window,
the <b>Page Down</b> key (or <b>space</b>) moves the view down
to start with the block below the topmost block whose beginning
is currently visible;
<b>Page Up</b> (or <b>Shift</b>-<b>space</b>) moves the view up
to start with the block above the topmost block whose beginning is
currently visible.
Vertical alignment scrolling can also be done with the mouse wheel.
</p><p>
The <b>Hide</b> button closes the sequence window without changing
the state of <b>Multalign Viewer</b>.
The sequence window can be reinvoked using the <b>Raise</b> option
for the <b>Multalign Viewer</b>
<a href="../../UsersGuide/instances.html">instance in the
<b>Tools</b> menu</a> (abbreviated <b>MAV</b>).
This is also useful when the window has become obscured by other windows.
<b>Help</b> opens this manual page in a browser window,
and <b>Quit</b> exits from <b>Multalign Viewer</b>.
</p>

<a name="numbering">
<h4>NUMBERING</h4></a>
<p>
Numbering can be displayed over the alignment and to the left and/or right
of the sequences.  Numbering displays can be controlled with the
<a href="#mavmenu-numberings"><b>Numberings</b> menu</a>.
</p><p>
<b><i>Alignment numbering</i></b> (for the alignment as a whole)
includes gap positions and always starts at 1.  
Whether it should be shown initially can be set in the
the <a href="#mavpref-analysis"><b>Headers</b> preferences</a>.
When present, alignment numbering is shown above any
<a href="#headers">headers</a>. 
</p><p>
<b><i>Sequence numbering</i></b> (for individual sequences)
includes only non-gap positions and can start with numbers other than 1.  
Sequence start numbers are set to 1 when an alignment is opened, except:
<ul>
<li>when a sequence is generated from a structure chain in Chimera
(for example, with 
<a href="../matchalign/matchalign.html"><b>Match -> Align</b></a>),
its start number is set to the number of the first residue in the 
structure chain
<li>when all sequence names in the alignment
are of the form <b><i>string/N&ndash;M</i></b>,
the trailing <b><i>/N&ndash;M</i></b> is stripped from the names and the
sequence start numbers are set to the respective values of <b><i>N</i></b>
</ul>
Sequence start numbers can be changed arbitrarily with
<a href="#seqnum"><b>Numberings... Adjust Sequence Numberings</b></a>.
Even with a correct start number, however, a sequence's numbering 
will be incorrect following any missing internal residues (for example, 
in a sequence derived from a structure missing a loop).
When an alignment is <a href="#saving">saved</a>, 
<a name="append-num">
<b><i>/N&ndash;M</i></b> can be appended to each sequence name,</a>
where <b><i>N</i></b> is the sequence's start number and 
<b><i>M</i></b> is calculated from <b><i>N</i></b> and the total number
of residues in the sequence.  
</p>

<a name="headers">
<h4>ALIGNMENT HEADERS</h4></a>
<p>
Headers are lines of information shown above an alignment in the
<a href="#seqwindow">sequence window</a>.
They can be hidden/shown with the checkboxes in the
<b>Multalign Viewer</b> <a href="#mavmenu-headers"><b>Headers</b> menu</a>.
How headers are calculated and which are shown initially (for alignments,
not single sequences) can be controlled in
the <a href="#mavpref-analysis"><b>Headers</b> preferences</a>.
Note that header usefulness will depend on what sequences 
are included in an alignment and whether they are aligned correctly.
</p><p>
The contents of a header can be <b><i>character</i></b>, a single
character per column,  or <b><i>numeric</i></b>, displayed as a histogram.
If the values in a numeric header fall within the range of 0 to 1, 
they will be used directly as histogram bar heights.  
If the range extends below 0 or above 1, the values will be
converted into histogram bar heights ranging from 0 to 1 according to:
    <blockquote>
    for values &ge; 0,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1 &ndash; &frac12;(<i>e</i><sup>&ndash;
value</sup>)
    </blockquote><blockquote>
    for values &lt; 0,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &frac12;(<i>e</i><sup>value</sup>)
    </blockquote>
However, the original values (not those used for histogram display) are
assigned as <a href="#mavAttributes">residue attributes</a>
and written out when header contents are <a href="#saveheader">saved</a>.
</p><p>
Headers may be <b><i>dynamic</i></b>, with values that update automatically 
when independent variables such as the sequence alignment or structure 
<a href="#association">associations</a> are changed, 
or <b><i>static</i></b>, with values that stay the same.
</p><p>
The following dynamic headers are available by default:
<ul>
<li><b>Consensus</b> - <a href="#consensus">consensus sequence</a>
as defined in the <a href="#mavpref-analysis"><b>Headers</b> preferences</a>
<li><b>Conservation</b> - <a href="#conservation">conservation</a>
as specified in the <a href="#mavpref-analysis"><b>Headers</b> preferences</a>
<li><b>Charge variation</b> 
- range of residue formal charges, assuming &ndash;1 for
D/E, +1 for H/K/R, and 0 for all other types
<li><b>RMSD</b> 
- spatial variation among the <a href="#association">associated</a> structures; 
root-mean-square distance using <a href="#onepoint">one point per residue</a>
associated with the column.
No value is calculated for columns with fewer than two
associated structure residues.
</ul>
Arbitrary, user-defined headers can also be shown:
<ul>
<li> Static headers can be added by reading in a
<a href="defineheader.html#headerformat">header definition file</a>
with <a href="#mavmenu-headers"><b>Headers... Load</b></a>
in the <b>Multalign Viewer</b> menu.
Loading values for a header with the same name as an
existing header will create an additional header line,
not replace the values in the existing header line.
GC (Generic per-Column) <a href="#annotations">annotations</a>
in alignments in
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockholm_format"
target="_blank">Stockholm format</a> are also treated as static headers.
<br><br>
<li> Dynamic headers can be defined with Python code.  
For examples, see the file <b>share/MAVHeader/ChimeraExtension.py</b> 
within the Chimera installation 
(it defines the <b>Charge variation</b> and <b>RMSD</b> headers 
described <a href="#headers">above</a>).
Rather than changing this file in the <b>MAVHeader</b> module, which might
be overwritten whenever a new version of Chimera is installed, users should
create an analogous file named <b>ChimeraExtension.py</b> 
in a different directory.
The <a href="../../UsersGuide/preferences.html#Tools"><b>Tools</b> 
preferences</a> can be used to add that directory's location 
(the directory above it) to the places Chimera should look for extensions.
</ul>
The following apply to headers other than 
<a href="#numbering">alignment numbering</a>:
<ul>
<li> Headers can be reordered (a header line is placed below the others
when turned on with the <a href="#mavmenu-headers"><b>Headers</b> menu</a>).
<li> Header line contents can be saved to a file
(<a href="#mavmenu-headers"><b>Headers... Save</b></a>
in the <b>Multalign Viewer</b> menu).
<li> Clicking within a header 
<a href="../../UsersGuide/selection.html">selects</a> any
structure residues <a href="#association">associated</a> 
with that column of the alignment.
<li> Values of headers are available as
<a href="#mavAttributes">residue attributes</a>
named <b>mav<i>HeaderName</i></b>
in any <a href="#association">associated</a> structures.
Numerical attributes will appear in the attribute lists of
<a href="../render/render.html"><b>Render/Select by Attribute</b></a>;
character attributes will be listed only in the
<a href="../render/render.html#select"><b>Select by Attribute</b></a> portion.
It may be necessary to 
<a href="../render/render.html#refreshing"><b>Refresh</b></a> 
the attribute menus or values in these tools to update them with any changes
in <b>Multalign Viewer</b> header information.
</ul>
</p>

<a name="regions">
<h4>ALIGNMENT REGIONS</h4></a>
<p>
Alignment <b><i>regions</i></b> can be defined manually
or by any of several operations within <b>Multalign Viewer</b>.
A region is shown using a colored rectangle or outline in the
<a href="#seqwindow">sequence window</a>; a single region can contain
any number of disjoint and/or abutting rectangular blocks.
Regions should be created as desired <b><i>after any 
<a href="#reorder">sequence reordering</a></i></b>, as that operation
will delete all existing regions.
</p><p>
<a name="manual">
A region can be created manually</a> by dragging with
the left mouse button within the <a href="#seqwindow">sequence window</a>.
Dragging downward into the following block highlights to the end of
the preceding block.
The initial region colors can be controlled in the
<a href="#mavpref-regions"><b>Regions</b> preferences</a>.
<b>Shift</b>-dragging with the left mouse button <b><i>adds to</i></b> the
<a href="#activeregion">active region</a>.
<b>Ctrl</b>-dragging <b><i>creates</i></b> a new region and makes it
the <a href="#activeregion">active region</a>.
</p><p>
<a name="activeregion">
The <b><i>active region</i></b> is the region most recently</a>
created manually, clicked on in the 
<a href="#seqwindow">sequence window</a>, or designated as 
<b>Active</b> in the <a href="#regionbrowser"><b>Region Browser</b></a>.
The corresponding parts of any <a href="#association">
associated</a> structures are highlighted in the main Chimera window by
becoming <a href="../../UsersGuide/selection.html">selected</a>.
Only one region can be active at a time.
In the <a href="#seqwindow">sequence window</a>, the active region is
indicated with a dashed outline; clicking the active region
deactivates it, and clicking a different region deactivates the
former active region and makes the new region active.
A region with no interior color
is only responsive to clicks on its borders.  
Where regions <a href="#overlap">overlap</a>,
only the highest is responsive to clicks.

More than one region can be chosen at a time.
The chosen region(s) are not necessarily <a href="#activeregion">active</a>.
</p><p>
The <b>Border color</b> and <b>Interior color</b> of the

adjacent <a href="../../UsersGuide/coloring.html#colorwell">color wells</a>.
One can specify whether the <a href="#chosenregions">chosen region(s)</a>
can <b>Include gaps</b>; when this setting is false, 
only residues and not gap positions will be enclosed.
Although a given region may then appear as disjoint blocks,
it will still be a single region.
</p><p>
The <b>Delete</b> button on the <b>Region Browser</b> deletes
the <a href="#chosenregions">chosen region(s)</a>. 
The region named <b>Chimera selection</b> cannot
be deleted, but it can include zero residues.
<a name="overlap">
Since regions may overlap, a region can be considered higher or
lower than another.</a>
<b>Raise</b> puts the <a href="#chosenregions">
chosen region(s)</a> in front of any other regions in the sequence window
and moves the corresponding entries in the <b>Region Browser</b> to the top.
<b>Lower</b> puts the 
<a href="#chosenregions">chosen region(s)</a> behind any overlapping
regions in the sequence window and moves the corresponding entries in the
<b>Region Browser</b> to to the bottom.
<b>Copy</b> copies the

The two <a href="jevtrace.html">formats</a>
are slightly different, but both contain information
for coloring regions in the sequence and in any <a href="#association">
associated</a> structures.
The file reader automatically determines which format is being used.
The formats are simple enough that users wishing to color residues alike
in sequence and structure (for any reason) may wish to
create a file manually and read it in by this route.

</p>

<a name="trees">
<h4>TREES</h4></a>
<p>
A <a href="http://evolution.genetics.washington.edu/phylip/newicktree.html"
target="_blank">Newick-format</a>
tree corresponding to the alignment can be read and displayed to
the left of the sequences with
<a href="#mavmenu-tree"><b>Tree... Load</b></a>
in the <b>Multalign Viewer</b> menu.
A newly loaded tree will replace any previously shown tree.
The tree can be hidden/shown with
<a href="#mavmenu-tree"><b>Tree... Show Tree</b></a>.
</p><p>
The sequence names in the tree must be the same as those in the alignment, 
and neither set of names can be a subset of the other. 
If the order of sequences in the tree differs from that in the alignment, 
a dialog will appear, requesting permission to reorder the alignment 
sequences for clearer display (to avoid tree branch crossings).
<b><i>Reordering will delete all 
<a href="#regions">region</a> information</b></i>,
although a region reflecting the current Chimera 
<a href="../../UsersGuide/selection.html">selection</a>
(if any) will subsequently (re)appear.
</p><p>
When the tree includes branch lengths, both solid and dotted lines 
are used for display, with horizontal solid line lengths proportional 
to branch lengths.  When the tree does not include branch lengths, 
only solid lines are used.
</p><p>
<a name="chosen-node">
Clicking a node in the tree makes it red and
chooses it for subsequent operations.</a>
<a href="#mavmenu-tree"><b>Tree... Extract Subalignment</b></a>
copies the sequences defined by the chosen node
into a separate <a href="#seqwindow">sequence window</a>.
The alignment of the sequences is kept exactly the same as in the
full alignment, including any all-gap columns, so that the subalignment 
is initially the same length as the full alignment.  If desired,
all-gap columns can be deleted with the 
<a href=""#mavmenu-edit"><b>Edit</b> menu</a>.
</p>

<a name="editing">
<h4>EDITING AND SAVING THE ALIGNMENT</h4></a>
<p>
Alignment editing allows rearranging residues and gaps without
changing the component sequences.  Residues cannot be created, deleted, 
mutated, or reordered within a sequence, but gap positions can be 
created and deleted.

<b>Ctrl</b>-key editing functions.
The <a href="#activeregion">active region</a> can be moved one
column at a time with <b>Ctrl</b>-left arrow and <b>Ctrl</b>-right arrow,
or as far as possible in one step with <b>Shift-Ctrl</b>-arrow (until the 
active region abuts either some other residues or the end of the alignment).
If the active region already abuts the alignment start or end,
new columns will be created as needed to accommodate the movement.  
Such movements can be undone step-by-step with <b>Ctrl</b>-down arrow
or collectively with <b>Ctrl-Esc</b>.  Only <b>Ctrl</b>-key editing 
can be undone, not the larger-scale operations described below
(sequence addition, deletion, and reordering).
Such larger-scale operations clear the editing history, but otherwise
all <b>Ctrl</b>-key editing operations are retained.
A previously undone movement can be redone with <b>Ctrl</b>-up arrow. 
Undo/redo repositions residues but not the
<a href="#activeregion">active region</a> box, since the
active region could have been changed during editing.
</p><p>
Sequences can be 
<a href="#add">added</a>, <a href="#reorder">reordered</a>, and

The <a href="#mavmenu-edit"><b>Edit</b> menu</a>
also allows <a href="#copy">copying a sequence as plain text</a> 
so it can be pasted into some other application window.
</p><p>
<a name="saving">
Choosing <a href="#mavmenu-file"><b>File... Save As</b></a>
from the <b>Multalign Viewer</b> menu</a>
brings up a <a href="../../UsersGuide/opensave.html">dialog</a> for
saving the sequence alignment to a file.  It is possible to save just the
<a href="#activeregion">active region</a> to a file; 
the region may consist of disjoint sections,
but each sequence (row) included must contain the same set of columns.
All-gap columns (for example, arising when a region to be saved includes
only a subset of the sequences) can be omitted from the output,
and <a href="#append-num">numbering can be appended</a> to the sequence names.
The <a href="../../UsersGuide/filetypes.html#alignment">sequence alignment
formats</a> available for saving are the same as those that can be read.
An alignment saved in
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockholm_format"
target="_blank">Stockholm format</a>
will automatically include
<a href="#stocksave">annotations describing the secondary structure</a>
of any <a href="#association">associated</a> structures.
</p><p>
The <a href="#seqwindow">sequence window</a> contents can also be
saved as an EPS file (<a href="#mavmenu-file"><b>File... Save EPS</b></a>
in the <b>Multalign Viewer</b> menu).

<a name="pid">
<h4>PERCENT IDENTITY</h4></a>
<p>
The percent identity between any pair of sequences in the alignment

<a href="#mavmenu-tools"><b>Tools... Percent Identity</b></a>
in the <b>Multalign Viewer</b> menu opens a dialog for specifying
the sequences (by name from the pulldown menus labeled

<ul>
<li><b>shorter sequence length</b> (default)
<li><b>longer sequence length</b>
<li><b>non-gap columns in common</b>
</ul>
The order in which the sequences are specified is not important.
</p><p>
<b>Apply</b> calculates the percent identity without dismissing the dialog,
while <b>OK</b> calculates the percent identity and dismisses the dialog.
The percent identity is reported in the
status area near the bottom of the <a href="#seqwindow">sequence window</a>

<h4>ANNOTATIONS</h4></a>
<p>
<a name="anno-ali">
Annotations and comments associated with an alignment as a whole</a>

<a href="#editanno"><b>Edit... Alignment Annotations</b></a>
in the <b>Multalign Viewer</b> menu.
Changes are not assessed for correctness.
</p><p>
Alignment <a name="annodef"><b><i>annotations</i></b></a> are
shown in the upper part of the dialog.  Each has two parts,
a name and a value (generally text).  For example, <b>MSF length</b>
is a possible name and <b>366</b> is a possible associated value.
A new annotation can be added by clicking <b>New</b>, specifying a name, and
then entering a value in the adjacent field.  
Values can have multiple lines even though only one is shown;
pressing return in a value field starts a new line,
but the previous information is retained.
Clicking <b>Delete</b> and then choosing an annotation

</ul>
</p>

<a name="association">
<h4>SEQUENCE-STRUCTURE ASSOCIATION</h4></a>
<p>
A sequence in the alignment will be associated automatically with
a structure chain if their sequences can be aligned without too many
mismatches.  The allowable number of mismatches is user-specified as a
proportion of the total number of residues in the structure chain
(1/10 by default; see 
the <a href="#mavpref-structure"><b>Structure</b> preferences</a>).
For automatic association, gaps in the structure sequence
relative to the sequence in the alignment file can only occur where
residues are missing from the structure (for example, a flexible
loop with insufficient density for coordinates to be determined).
The order in which the sequence and structure files are opened
does not matter.  Associations are reported in the
status area near the bottom of the <a href="#seqwindow">sequence window</a>
and the Chimera <a href="../../UsersGuide/reply.html"><b>Reply Log</b></a>.
A structure (even if it has multiple chains) cannot be associated with more
than one sequence, but a single sequence can be associated with 
more than one structure.
If more than one sequence matches a given structure chain,
the single best-matching sequence is associated.
</p><p>
Associations can be <a href="#assocpanel">changed or added</a>
if the automated procedure does not give the desired result.
</p><p>
The names of structure-associated sequences are shown in bold over a
box indicating the 
<a href="../../UsersGuide/hierarchy.html">model-level color</a>
of the structure.
For example, <b>APE_HUMAN</b> in the <a href="#seqwindow">sequence window
figure</a> is associated with a structure whose model-level color is white.
If multiple models are associated with the same sequence, 
the box is shown as a dark green dashed outline.
When the cursor is placed over the <i>name</i> of a sequence,
information on the sequence and any associated structure(s) is shown in the
status area near the bottom of the <a href="#seqwindow">sequence window</a>.
When the cursor is placed over a sequence <i>residue</i> that is associated
with a residue in one or more structures, information on the structure
residue(s) is given.
Association information can be <a href="#saveassoc">saved to a file</a>.
</p><p>
Sequence-structure association may create new <a href="#regions">regions</a>.
If all residues of a sequence are matched, no region is created.
Otherwise, regions are created containing the matched segment(s),
any mismatches, and any gaps in the structure relative to the sequence.
The region names report the associated structure chain 
and the number of gaps or mismatches.
The initial colors and display status (shown or hidden) of these regions can be
controlled in the <a href="#mavpref-regions"><b>Regions</b> preferences</a>.
</p><p>
<a name="crosstalk">
Association enables several types of sequence-structure crosstalk:
</a>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Clicking/dragging on sequence &rarr; structure selection</b>.
 <ul>
 <li>When a <a href="#regions">region</a> is made the

 </ul>
<li>
<a name="selregion"><b>Structure selection &rarr; sequence region</b>.</a>
By default, making a <a href="../../UsersGuide/selection.html">selection</a>
in one or more sequence-associated structures will create a 
<a href="#regions">region</a> named <b>Chimera selection</b> in the
associated sequences.  Every residue with at least
one atom or bond selected will be included in the region.
The color of the region and whether it should be created
can be controlled in the
<a href="#mavpref-regions"><b>Regions</b> preferences</a>.
The region will not be created when the selection
merely reflects the current <a href="#activeregion">active region</a>.
<li>
<b>Focusing the view</b>.
 <ul>
 <li>Clicking with the right mouse button on a structure-associated

 the graphics window view on the corresponding structure residue(s).
 <li><b>Shift</b>-right-clicking

<a name="superposition">
<h4>STRUCTURAL SUPERPOSITION</h4></a>
<p>
<a href="#mavmenu-structure"><b>Structure... Match</b></a> in the

allows structures to be superimposed based on
the alignment of their <a href="#association">associated</a> sequences.
The dialog contains two subpanels, each listing the structures 
<a href="#association">associated</a> with sequences in the alignment.
One reference structure should be chosen in the left side, but any number
of structures to be matched (superimposed)
with it can be chosen in the right side.
Residues in each <b>Structure to match</b> are paired with
the aligned (in the sequence alignment) residues of the <b>Reference
structure</b>.  If both structures are <a href="#association">associated</a>
with the same sequence, the correspondence is even more obvious.
<a name="onepoint">
Fitting uses one point per residue</a>:  CA in
amino acid residues and C4' in nucleic acid residues.
If a nucleic acid residue lacks a C4' atom 
(some lower-resolution structures are P traces), 
its P atom will be paired with the P atom of the aligned residue. 
The number of atom pairs fitted and the resulting RMSD are reported in the
Chimera <a href="../../UsersGuide/reply.html"><b>Reply Log</b></a> and the
status area near the bottom of the <a href="#seqwindow">sequence window</a>.
</p><p>
<b>Match highly conserved residues only</b> causes only the well-conserved

is created and colored uniquely (in order, the
<a href="../../UsersGuide/colortables.html#allcolors">named colors</a>
dark green, dodger blue, sienna, yellow, spring green, purple, gray,

refers to an iterative fitting procedure: in each cycle,
atom pairs are removed from the match list and the remaining
pairs are fitted, until no matched pair is
more than <i>x</i> angstroms apart (<i>x</i>=<b>2.0</b> by default).
The atom pairs removed are either the 10% farthest apart of all pairs
or the 50% farthest apart of all pairs exceeding the cutoff, whichever
is the lesser number of pairs.
The result is that the best-matching "core" regions are maximally
superimposed; conformationally dissimilar regions such as flexible

<li><a name="insert"><b>Insert All-Gap Columns</b></a> - open a dialog
for inserting all-gap columns into the alignment (presumably to facilitate

<b>OK</b> and <b>Apply</b> insert the gap columns with and without
dismissing the dialog, respectively.
<li><a name="delete"><b>Delete Sequences/Gaps...</b></a>
open a dialog for deleting sequences and/or all-gap columns.
One or more sequences can be slated for deletion by choosing their names
from the list.  <b>Ctrl</b>-click toggles the status of a sequence.
To choose a block of sequences without dragging,
click on the first (or last) and then <b>Shift</b>-click 
on the last (or first) in the desired block.
<b>Delete all-gap columns</b> indicates that columns containing only
gaps (evaluated after sequence deletion, if any) should be removed.
Clicking <b>Apply</b> (or <b>OK</b>, which also closes the dialog) 
performs the indicated deletions.
<br><br>
<li><a name="add"><b>Add Sequence</b></a> -
open a dialog for adding a new sequence to the alignment. 
A <b>Sequence name</b> should be specified.
The new sequence will be aligned to the others using the Needleman-Wunsch 
algorithm (unless <a href="#addplain">plain text</a>
is <a href="#simply-append">simply appended</a>).
<b>The existing alignment will not be changed, 
except that gap positions may be inserted 
<i>between</i> columns of the existing alignment.</b>
Clicking <b>Apply</b> (or <b>OK</b>, which also closes the dialog) 
adds the sequence to the alignment.
<br><br>
Sequence input options:
  <ul>
  <li> <a name="addplain"><b>Plain Text</b></a> - add a sequence
  that has been entered or pasted in the <b>Sequence</b> field as plain text.
  It will be converted to upper case and any spaces removed automatically.
  <a name="simply-append">
  The sequence should not contain gap characters, unless (with gaps) it is
  exactly the same length as the existing alignment and the option to
  <b>Simply append...</b> is on.
  </a>
  <li> <a name="addstruct"><b>From Structure</b></a>
  - add the sequence of a structure chain open in Chimera 
  </ul><br>
Alignment parameters:
  <ul>
  <li> <a name="AAscore"><b>Matrix</b> (default <b>BLOSUM-62</b>)</a> - 
  <a href="../../UsersGuide/midas/mmaker.html#matrix">substitution matrix</a>
  for scoring the alignment.  The score for aligning a residue in the new 
  sequence with a column in the existing alignment is the sum of the 
  matrix values for the residue versus each of the residues in the column 
  (and zero versus a gap position)
  divided by the number of sequences (rows) in the existing alignment. 
  This contribution over the entire alignment is the <b><i>residue
  similarity score</i></b>.  In some cases there will also be a
  <a href="#SSscore"><b><i>secondary structure score</i></b></a>.
  <li><a name="penalty"><b>Opening penalty</b> (default <b>12</b>)</a>
   - penalty for opening
  a gap in the existing alignment, regardless of whether it is already
  flanked by gaps in any of the sequences. 
  For opening a gap in the new sequence, 
  this penalty is scaled by the fraction of sequences
  in the existing alignment not gapped at that position.
  When <a href="#SSscore">secondary structure scoring</a> is used, 
  secondary-structure-specific gap opening penalties apply instead.
  <li> <b>Extension penalty</b> (default <b>1</b>) - penalty for extending 
  a gap between columns of the existing alignment.  
  For extending a gap in the new sequence, 
  this penalty is scaled by the fraction of sequences
  in the existing alignment not gapped at that position.
  <li> <b>Character</b> (default is the most prevalent gap character in the 
  existing alignment, or the character <b>.</b> if the alignment lacks gaps)
  - character for displaying 
  gap positions created during alignment of the new sequence
  <li><a name="SSscore"><b>Include secondary structure score (<i>N</i>%)</b></a>
  - include a secondary structure term in the alignment score
  and use secondary-structure-specific gap opening penalties.
  This option only applies when one is adding a sequence 
  <a href="#addstruct">from a structure</a> and
  at least one other sequence in the alignment is already
  <a href="#association">associated</a> with a structure.
  Detailed settings can be shown by clicking <b>Show parameters</b>, 
  hidden again by clicking <b>Hide parameters</b>.  
  <b><i>N</i></b> reflects the relative weights of the terms,
  which can be adjusted by moving the slider.  If N is 30, for example,
  <blockquote>
total score = 0.70(residue similarity score) + 0.30(secondary structure score)
&ndash; gap penalties
</blockquote>
The values in the secondary structure <b>Scoring matrix</b>
(for all pairwise combinations of <b>H</b> helix, <b>S</b> strand, and
<b>O</b> other) and the secondary-structure-specific
<b>Gap opening penalties</b> can be adjusted.
The secondary structure score is computed in the same way as described for the
<a href="#AAscore">residue similarity score</a>, except that sequences
without associated structures contribute neither to the score nor to the
sequence count used for normalization.  
When secondary structure scoring is used (even if the slider is
set to zero), 
<ul>
<li>the secondary-structure-specific <b>Gap opening penalties</b>
are used instead of the single <a href="#penalty"><b>Opening penalty</b></a>
<li>the <b>Extension penalty</b> remains the same
<li>the total penalty is computed as described <a href="#penalty">above</a>,
except that sequences without associated structures contribute neither to
the penalty nor to the sequence count used for normalization
</ul>
Contributions from multiple structures associated with the same sequence
in the alignment are averaged so that the sequence only counts "once."
<p>
The alignment parameter values last used for adding a sequence are retained. 
However, <b>Reset...</b> buttons are provided for restoring the general
alignment parameters (those other than secondary structure scoring) and
secondary structure scoring parameters to their factory defaults.
