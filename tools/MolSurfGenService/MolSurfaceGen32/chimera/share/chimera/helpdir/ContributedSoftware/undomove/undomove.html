<h3>Undo Move <img src="undo.png" alt="Undo Move icon">
and Redo Move <img src="redo.png" alt="Redo Move icon"></h3>
<p>
<b>Undo Move</b> allows backtracking through the most recent model
positions.  This is useful when a structural alignment
or docking of models relative to one another is accidentally destroyed
by moving one or more models when the others are fixed.
<b>Redo Move</b> allows previously undone movements to be reapplied.
There are <a href="../../UsersGuide/extension.html">
several ways to call</a> <b>Undo Move</b> and <b>Redo Move</b>,
tools in the <b>Movement</b> category.
</p><p>
As soon Chimera is started, the positions of all open models
are stored whenever motion stops for at least one second,
a new model is opened, or <b>Undo Move</b> or <b>Redo Move</b> is used.
The many intermediate positions that occur during motions are not recorded.
Only rotations and translations are recorded, not scale,
clipping plane positions, or other
<a href="../../UsersGuide/sideview.html#camera"><b>Camera</b></a> settings.
Only the 100 most recent sets of positions are saved.
</p><p>
When <b>Undo Move</b> is used to to regenerate positions saved
before a model was opened, that model is not moved.
