<h3>Hide Dust <img src="hidedusticon.png" alt="Hide Dust icon"></h3>
<p>
<b>Hide Dust</b> hides smaller <b><i>blobs</i></b> (disconnected parts)
of a surface.  One use is to simplify the display of noisy 
<a href="../../UsersGuide/filetypes.html#volume">volume data</a>.
See also: 
<a href="gaussian.html"><b>Volume Filter</b></a>,
<a href="../pickblobs/pickblobs.html"><b>Measure and Color Blobs</b></a>
</p><p>
There are <a href="../../UsersGuide/extension.html">several ways to start</a>
<b>Hide Dust</b>, a tool in the <b>Volume Data</b> category
(including from the
<a href="framevolumeviewer.html" target="_top"><b>Volume Viewer</b></a>
<b>Tools</b> menu).
</p><p>
The surface of interest should be displayed and then
<a name="choosesurf">chosen</a> from the <b>Surface</b> menu.
Blobs can be measured in various ways; the cutoff value and slider 
refer to the method specified in the <a href="#options">options</a>.
</p><p>
Nothing will happen until <b>Hide</b> is clicked.  
Clicking <b>Hide</b> limits the display of the chosen surface 
using the current settings and initiates automatic updates of that surface 
as the cutoff or measurement method is changed.
The cutoff can be changed by typing a new value or dragging the slider.  
Changes affect only the currently chosen surface.
Choosing another surface from the menu suspends updating of the 
previously chosen surface, but its cutoff and measurement method will be
retained until it is unhidden.  It is necessary to click 
<b>Hide</b> again to initiate automatic updating 
of the newly chosen surface (unless previously initiated).
Clicking <b>Unhide</b> stops hiding blobs of the currently chosen surface 
and halts its automatic updates.
</p><p>
<a name="options">Clicking <b>Options</b></a> reveals the measurement setting
(clicking the close button <img src ="../volumeviewer/x.png"</a> on the right
hides it again):
<ul>
<li><b>Hide small blobs based on</b>
  <ul>
  <li><b>size</b> - bounding box dimension (largest of X, Y, Z)
  <li><b>rank</b> - rank of <b>size</b> (a value of <i>N</i> indicates
  showing the <i>N</i> largest blobs by the <b>size</b> criterion)
  <li><b>volume</b> - enclosed volume
  </ul>
</ul>
<b>Close</b> dismisses the <b>Hide Dust</b> dialog; <b>Help</b>
opens this manual page in a browser window.
