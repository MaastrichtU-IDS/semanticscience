<b>Icosahedron Surface</b> creates a surface representing
a linear interpolation between an icosahedron and a sphere.
The surface is for comparison to virus particles with icosahedral symmetry;
it can be colored by density data for such structures with
<a href="../../ContributedSoftware/surfcolor/surfcolor.html"><b>Surface
Color</b></a>.  <b>Icosahedron Surface</b> information is saved in
<a href="../../UsersGuide/sessions.html#sesdef">sessions</a>.

There are <a href="../../UsersGuide/extension.html">several ways to start</a>
<b>Icosahedron Surface</b>, a tool in the 
<b>Higher-Order Structure</b> category.
</p><p>
Clicking <b>Show</b> creates the surface according to the settings:
<ul>
<li><b>Radius</b> - radius of the sphere component and
distance from the center to a vertex of the icosahedron component 
(the default is <b>100</b> display units, 
generally &Aring;); the value can be changed by entering a different
number or by moving the slider.
<li><a name="factor"><b>Sphere factor</b></a> 
- weight to use for the sphere component, where
<b>0</b> (default) yields an icosahedron and 1 yields a sphere; the value 
can be changed by entering a different number or by moving the slider.
Values outside the range 0-1 can be used, but negative values such that
surface points pass through the origin will cause subsequent
<b>Sphere factor</b> settings to produce the wrong surface.
<li><b>Orientation</b> - orientation of the icosahedron 
  <ul>
  <li><b>xyz 2-fold axes</b> (default)
   - with two-fold symmetry axes of the icosahedron along the x, y and z axes.
   In the <a href="#untransformed">untransformed</a> icosahedron, 
   a <b><i>vertically oriented edge</i></b> points at the user.  
  (<a name="untransformed">Objects are untransformed</a> when
   no rotations/translations have been performed, or when the view has been 
  <a href="../../UsersGuide/midas/reset.html"><b>reset</b></a> to the default.)
  <li><b>xyz 2-fold axes, alt</b>
  - as above, except rotated 90&deg; about the z axis.
   In the <a href="#untransformed">untransformed</a> icosahedron, 
   a <b><i>horizontally oriented edge</i></b> points at the user.  
  <li><b>x 2-fold, z 3-fold</b>
   - with a two-fold symmetry axis of the icosahedron along the x axis and a 
   three-fold symmetry axis along the z axis.
   The y axis does not coincide with a symmetry axis.  
   A <b><i>face</i></b> of the <a href="#untransformed">untransformed</a>
   icosahedron points at the user. 
  <li><b>x 2-fold, z 3-fold, alt</b>
  - as above, except rotated 180&deg; about the y axis.
  <li><b>x 2-fold, z 5-fold</b>
   -  with a two-fold symmetry axis of the icosahedron along the x axis and a 
   five-fold symmetry axis along the z axis. 
   The y axis does not coincide with a symmetry axis.
   A <b><i>vertex</i></b> of the <a href="#untransformed">untransformed</a>
   icosahedron points at the user. 
  <li><b>x 2-fold, z 5-fold, alt</b>
  - as above, except rotated 180&deg; about the y axis.
  <li><b>y 2-fold, z 5-fold</b>
   -  with a two-fold symmetry axis of the icosahedron along the y axis and a 
   five-fold symmetry axis along the z axis. 
   The x axis does not coincide with a symmetry axis.
   A <b><i>vertex</i></b> of the <a href="#untransformed">untransformed</a>
   icosahedron points at the user. 
  <li><b>y 2-fold, z 5-fold, alt</b>
  - as above, except rotated 180&deg; about the x axis.
  </ul>
<li><a name="subdivision"><b>Subdivision factor</b></a>
 - how finely to subdivide the surface.
A factor of <b>1</b> (default) yields 20 triangles, the 20 faces of 
the icosahedron.  Values represent the number of subdivisions 
within an edge of the icosahedron, and only non-negative
powers of 2 are used (1, 2, 4, 8, ...).  
Other numbers can be entered, but will be rounded to a power of 2. 
The <b>spacing</b> is the length of a subdivision.
<li><a name="style"><b>Surface style</b></a>
- whether the surface should be shown as <b>solid</b> or <b>mesh</b>
<li><b>Color</b> 
- a <a href="../../UsersGuide/coloring.html#colorwell">color well</a> 
specifying the surface color
</ul>
Only one "icosahedral" surface can be present at a time.
Changing any parameter automatically updates the surface.
<b>Remove</b> closes this surface model, while
<b>Close</b> dismisses the <b>Icosahedron Surface</b> dialog.
<b>Help</b> opens this manual page in a browser window.

<h4>TECHNICAL NOTES</h4></a>

<p>
<b>Rounded edges</b>. 
Even when the <a href="#factor"><b>Sphere factor</b></a> 
is zero, the edges of the icosahedron may appear to be rounded 
because of the way the model is lit. 
This is especially noticable in the <b>solid</b> 
<a href="#style">display style</a>. 
Each surface vertex has a normal vector that determines how light 
reflects off the surface.
The vertices at the edges between faces of the icosahedron
have a normal vector midway between the normals of the faces.
This causes the edges to appear rounded instead of sharp. 
A higher <a href="#subdivision"><b>Subdivision factor</b></a>
(<i>e.g.</i>, 32 or 64) will make the edges look sharper.
</p>

<p>
<b>Coloring</b>. 
The <a href="../../ContributedSoftware/surfcolor/surfcolor.html"><b>Surface
Color</b></a> tool assigns each surface vertex a color; 
between vertices, the colors are interpolated. 
More detailed color variations will be apparent with a higher
<a href="#subdivision"><b>Subdivision factor</b></a>.
