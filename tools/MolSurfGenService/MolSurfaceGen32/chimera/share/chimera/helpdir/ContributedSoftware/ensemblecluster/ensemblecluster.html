<h3>Ensemble Cluster
<img src="ensembleclusticon.png" alt="Ensemble Cluster icon"></h3>
<p>
<b>Ensemble Cluster</b> clusters members of a conformational ensemble (where
each member contains the same atoms) and determines cluster representatives.
It is a reimplementation of the method described in:
<blockquote>
<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8961360" target="_blank">
An automated approach for clustering an ensemble of NMR-derived 
protein structures into conformationally related subfamilies.</a>
Kelley LA, Gardner SP, Sutcliffe MJ.
<i>Protein Eng.</i> 1996 Nov;9(11):1063-5.

</p><p>
First, the ensemble of interest should be opened in Chimera 
from a single PDB file in which <tt>MODEL</tt> and <tt>ENDMDL</tt> records 
delimit the different structures (for example,
<a href="../../UsersGuide/tutorials/1plx.pdb">1plx</a>).
</p><p>
There are <a href="../../UsersGuide/extension.html">several ways to start</a>
<b>Ensemble Cluster</b>, a tool in the <b>Structure Comparison</b> and
<b>MD/Ensemble Analysis</b> categories.  When it is started,
a list of the open models will appear.  The model containing the ensemble 
should be designated as the <b>Ensemble to Cluster</b>.  Which atoms
to consider (<b>Parts to Match</b>) can be indicated with a command-line-style
<a href="../../UsersGuide/midas/atom_spec.html#basic">atom specification</a>,
or the field can be left blank to include all atoms.
</p><p>
<b>OK</b> dismisses the model list and starts the clustering calculation,
while <b>Apply</b> starts the calculation without dismissing the list.
</p>
<table border="1" align="right" style="margin:8px 8px 8px 8px"> 
<tr><td><img src="clusterlist.png" alt="Cluster List"></td></tr>
</table>
<p>
The calculation may take several minutes, depending on the size and
number of structures in the ensemble.  
Pairwise best-fit RMSD values are computed (without moving the structures)
and written to the <a href="../../UsersGuide/reply.html"><b>Reply Log</b></a>.
When the calculation finishes,
a dialog will appear listing the clusters, their sizes, and the
<a href="../../UsersGuide/midas/atom_spec.html#subcats">model IDs</a>
of their conformational representatives.
</p><p>
<a name="chosen">
In the list, one or more clusters can be
<b><i>chosen</i></b> with the left mouse button.</a>
Chosen lines are highlighted in the dialog.
<b>Ctrl</b>-click toggles the status of a line, while clicking on the first 
(or last) line of a contiguous block and then <b>Shift</b>-clicking 
on the last (or first) chooses all of the lines in the block.
</p><p>
Clicking the black arrowhead reveals/hides options for the 
<b>Treatment of Chosen Clusters</b>.  Each option applies to a
<b><i>target</i></b> of either <b>all members</b> or just the
<b>representatives</b> of the chosen clusters:
<ul>
<li><b>Select atoms of [<i>target</i>]</b>
- <a href="../../UsersGuide/selection.html">select</a> all atoms
<li><b>Color [<i>target</i>]</b>
- color the structures and list text to match, using a different
color for each chosen cluster
<li><b>Choose [<i>target</i>] in Model Panel</b>
- also choose the structures in the
<a href="../../UsersGuide/modelpanel.html"><b>Model Panel</b></a>
for further operations.  The <b>Model Panel</b>
<a href="../../UsersGuide/modelpanel.html#functions">functions</a>
include <b>show only</b>, <b>tile</b>, <b>match</b>, <b>focus</b>,
and <b>write PDB</b>; in most further dialogs,
the same models will be chosen automatically.
</ul>
These option settings are saved in the
<a href="../../UsersGuide/preferences.html#preffile"><b>preferences</b> file</a>
for subsequent uses of <b>Ensemble Cluster</b>.
</p><p>
If the cluster list is hidden (by clicking the <b>Hide</b> button) or
becomes obscured by other windows, it
can be resurrected using the <b>Raise</b> option for its
<a href="../../UsersGuide/instances.html">instance in the
<b>Tools</b> menu</a>.  <b>Quit</b> closes the table
and exits from <b>Ensemble Cluster</b>.
<b>Help</b> opens this manual page in a browser window.
