<h3>Benchmark <img src="benchicon.png" alt="Benchmark icon"></h3>
<p>
<b>Benchmark</b> measures graphics card and CPU performance on
standard Chimera rendering tasks.  It facilitates comparisons among
hardware systems, and for users with access to different systems,
indicates which will give the best performance with Chimera.
Results can be sent to the Chimera developers for inclusion in the
<a href="http://plato.cgl.ucsf.edu/trac/chimera/wiki/benchmarks"
target="_blank">benchmark Web page</a>.
</p><p>
There are <a href="../../UsersGuide/extension.html">several ways to start</a>
<b>Benchmark</b>, a tool in the <b>Utilities</b> category.
</p><p>
For accurate results, any models open in Chimera should be closed
and any other processes running on the system should be halted before
benchmarks are run.  Other windows should not be placed on top of the
Chimera graphics window during benchmark calculations.
</p><p>
The top part of the <b>Benchmark</b> panel contains explanatory text. 
Clicking <b>Run Benchmarks</b> performs all of the benchmark tasks
(which may take several minutes) and appends the results to this text.
The tasks include rendering <a href="#molecule">atomic coordinates</a>
and <a href="#volume">volume data</a>.
Clicking <b>Halt</b> aborts benchmark calculations in progress.
After the full set of benchmarks has been run, the
<b>Report Scores</b> button can be clicked.
<b>Report Scores</b> uses the bug-reporting system to
send the results to the Chimera developers for inclusion in the
<a href="http://plato.cgl.ucsf.edu/trac/chimera/wiki/benchmarks"
target="_blank">benchmark Web page</a>.
<b>Show scores reported by others</b> opens that page in a browser window.
</p><p>
Typically, <b>Measure frame rate continuously</b> (every second)
<b>or one time</b> (when that button is clicked) would not be used during
a benchmark run, but instead to evaluate the <b><i>actual</i></b>
frame rate during some manually executed display task.
On some systems, <b>Benchmark</b> results are affected by the
monitor refresh rate.  The actual frame rate is additionally subject to the
fixed delay introduced by Chimera (upper limit ~30 frames/sec).
</p><p>
<b>Close</b> dismisses the <b>Benchmark</b> interface, and <b>Help</b>
opens this manual page in a browser window.

<h3>Individual Benchmarks</h3>
<p>
<b>Show individual test controls</b> displays buttons for running
the various benchmarks individually.  
<ul>
<li><a name="molecule"><b>molecule</b></a> -
render a macromolecular structure, PDB entry 1f4h.  
The structure is opened and shown in various
<a href="../../UsersGuide/representation.html">representations</a>.
The values reported are:
  <ul>
  <li> frames per second in each representation,
  including <b>Null</b> (open but not displayed)
  <li> operations per second (<b>Ops</b>), where an operation consists of
  flipping the display status of each atom computationally
  but not visibly; this is a measure of CPU performance
  </ul>
</ul>
<a name="volume">
The remaining benchmarks use volume data, a grid of numbers.</a>
<ul>
<li><b>surface</b> - measure the OpenGL rendering rate for triangles
by drawing the surface of the cube
<li><b>mesh</b> - measure the OpenGL rendering rate for lines by drawing
a mesh surface of the cube
<li><b>contour</b> - measure CPU and memory performance by contouring
a Gaussian bump in the cube at a threshold that produces a spherical
surface occupying nearly the whole volume (not displayed)
<li><b>solid</b> - measure two-dimensional texture mapping performance
by making each point in the cube opaque white
<li><b>recolor</b> - measure bandwidth to the graphics card
by repeatedly updating the color at each point in the cube
</ul>
Each volume benchmark finds and reports the edge size N of an N by N by N cube 
on which the task can be performed at 10 frames per second (fps).
An iterative approach is used
to find the data size that can be handled at 10 fps; if this fails
to converge, the <b>Halt</b> button can be used to stop the calculation.
This edge size is also called the <b><i>score</i></b> for the task.
Data that can be handled at 10 fps is easily manipulable in Chimera.
</p><p>
Pressing one of the buttons next to <b>Show standard model</b>
(<b>surface</b>, <b>mesh</b>, or <b>solid</b>) 
will open the specified model type 
of the specified <b>size</b> in the graphics window.
Depending on the size and viewing angle, a <b>solid</b> model may look like
a stack of planes; this is an artifact of the rendering procedure.
The models can be closed with the
<a href="../../UsersGuide/modelpanel.html"><b>Model Panel</b></a>
or the command
<a href="../../UsersGuide/midas/open.html"><b>close</b></a>.

Rendering time depends on window size and model position
within the view; these can be set as in the benchmark runs using
the <b>Set standard view</b> buttons <b>camera</b> (position and orientation
of model within the view) and <b>window size</b> (512 x 512 pixels).

<h4>TECHNICAL NOTES</h4></a>
<p>
<b>Chimera window comes to top</b>.
When the Chimera graphics window is covered
by other windows, some systems will shortcut the drawing process.
Running any of the benchmarks brings the graphics window to the top.
</p><p>
<b>Timing method</b>.
The benchmark timings use wall clock time (the Python time.time() call)
instead of CPU time (Python time.clock()) because the latter does not
measure the time used by the graphics card. 
</p><p>
<b>Insufficient memory</b>.
The <b>solid</b> volume benchmark can run out of memory on a machine with fast
graphics relative to main memory size. 
</p><p>
<b>Convergence method</b>.
Iterative bisection is used to find the 10 fps size for volume data.
An alternative is to get the time for a given size and use a scaling law.
However, there is no simple relationship between rate and data size;
pixel fill rate, number of primitives, texture memory size, and CPU cache size
can all cause hard-to-predict scaling behavior.
