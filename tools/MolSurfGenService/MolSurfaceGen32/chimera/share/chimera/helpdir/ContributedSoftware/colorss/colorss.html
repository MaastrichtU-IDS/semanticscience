<p>
<b>Color Secondary Structure</b> colors peptides/proteins by
secondary structure: helix, strand, or other.
Helix and strand assignments are taken from the input structure
file or generated with <a href="../../UsersGuide/midas/ksdssp.html"><b>ksdssp</b></a>.
Molecules other than peptides and proteins are not affected.
</p><p>
There are <a href="../../UsersGuide/extension.html">several ways to start</a>

Checkboxes control which types of secondary structure will be colored,
and the colors can be changed using the adjacent

<li><b>Other</b>
