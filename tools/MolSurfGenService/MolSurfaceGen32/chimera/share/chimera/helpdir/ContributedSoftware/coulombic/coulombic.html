<h3>Coulombic Surface Coloring <img src="coulombicon.png"

<p>
<b>Coulombic Surface Coloring</b> colors
<a href="../../UsersGuide/representation.html#surfaces">molecular surfaces</a>
by electrostatic potential calculated with Coulomb's law:
<blockquote>
<font size ="+1">
&phi; = &Sigma; [q<sub>i</sub> / (&epsilon;d<sub>i</sub>)]
</font>
</blockquote>
&phi; is the potential (which varies in space),
q are the atomic partial charges,
d are the distances from the atoms, and
&epsilon; is the dielectric, representing screening by the medium or solvent.
A distance-dependent dielectric (&epsilon; = <i>C</i>d where <i>C</i> is some 
constant) is sometimes used to approximate screening by implicit solvent.
</p><p>
The
<a href="../surfcolor/surfcolor.html"><b>Electrostatic Surface Coloring</b></a>
tool is similar, but uses an 
<a href="../../UsersGuide/filetypes.html#esp">electrostatic potential map</a>
previously calculated with any of several 
<a href="../../UsersGuide/filetypes.html#esp">separate programs</a>
not included with Chimera.  These continuum electrostatics programs 
perform calculations that are more complex and (if done correctly) more
accurate than simple Coulomb's law approaches.
However, a Coulombic potential may suffice for visualization.

There are <a href="../../UsersGuide/extension.html">several ways to start</a>
<b>Coulombic Surface Coloring</b>, a tool
in the <b>Surface/Binding Analysis</b> category.
</p><p>
The 
<a href="../../UsersGuide/representation.html#surfaces">molecular surface(s)</a>
should first be displayed (using <b>Actions... Surface... show</b>
or the command <a href="../../UsersGuide/midas/surface.html"><b>surface</b></a>)
and then chosen from the list of <b>Surfaces to color by ESP</b>. 
Only the residues enclosed by a surface will be used
to calculate the potential on that surface.
For example, nearby ions, solvent, or ligand molecules will not affect
the results for a surface that encloses only protein,
and it is not possible to show the potential from one molecule on the
surface of another.
<ul>
<li><b>Number of colors/values</b> 
(default <b>3</b>: <b>red</b>, <b>white</b>, and <b>blue</b>)
- up to 11 pairs can be used. 
Each color can be adjusted by clicking its 
<a href="../../UsersGuide/coloring.html#colorwell">color well</a> and 
using the <a href="../../UsersGuide/colortool.html"><b>Color Editor</b></a>.
The values can be edited directly (units are kcal/mol&middot;e at 298 K).
<!--
Eric: potentials calculated with proton charge units and Angstroms
get scaled by a factor of 331.62, which according to the midas
esp source code converts them to "Kcals energy units". 
ECM: I believe it is actually kcal/mol per proton charge at 25C = 298K.
Note DelPhi ESP is in kT/e and 1 kT = 0.593 kcal/mol at 298 K.
-->
<p>
The specified color/value pairs or thresholds define a color mapping.
The value calculated for each surface vertex will be compared to the thresholds.
Surface vertices with values lower than any threshold will be assigned the 
color of the lowest-value threshold, while vertices with values higher than
any threshold will be assigned the color of the highest-value threshold.  
The colors of the remaining vertices will be obtained by linear 
interpolation between the nearest lower and higher thresholds.
Finally, each surface triangle will be colored by linearly interpolating
its vertex colors.
Colors are defined by red, green, blue, and opacity/transparency components. 
</p>
<li><b>Distance-dependent dielectric</b> (<b>true</b>/false) 
- whether &epsilon; should vary in proportion to the distance from each charge
<li><b>Dielectric constant</b> (default <b>4.0</b>)
- value of <i>C</i>, where &epsilon; = <i>C</i>d if distance-dependent,
&epsilon; = <i>C</i> if not distance-dependent
<li><b>Distance from surface</b> (default <b>1.4</b> &Aring;)
- how far out from each surface vertex, along its normal,
to evaluate the electrostatic potential.  The rationale for looking outward
is that the values at the centers of any interacting atoms are more relevant
than those at their surfaces.  A 
<a href="../../UsersGuide/representation.html#surfaces">molecular surface</a>
is <b><i>solvent-excluded</i></b>; it shows where the surface of a 
spherical probe (typically of radius 1.4 &Aring;) can lie.  Thus, 1.4 &Aring; 
out from the molecular surface is about as close as the probe center
can get, the <b><i>solvent-accessible</i></b> surface.
</ul>
<a name="hisprot">
The <b>Implicit Histidine Protonation</b> section controls the charge states
of histidines in structures without hydrogens.</a>
Although hydrogens will not be added explicitly, the implicit 
protonation states will affect the results because the charges differ
throughout the residue for different
<a href="../addcharge/addcharge.html#alterstates">protonation states</a>,
and the charges of the implicit hydrogens will be merged 
with those of the attached heavy atoms.
<ul>
<li><b>Residue name-based</b>
- residue names will be used to determine which histidine sidechain 
nitrogens should be implicitly protonated: the &delta;-nitrogen
in residues named HID, the &epsilon;-nitrogen in HIE, and both 
nitrogens in HIP.  
The <b>HIS =</b> setting specifies how residues with the standard histidine
name (HIS) should be treated:
  <ul>
  <li><b>estimated from H-bonds</b> (default) 
  - choose protonation state based on local H-bonding environment
  <li><b>delta</b> 
  - neutral sidechain, implicit hydrogen at &delta;-nitrogen
  <li><b>epsilon</b> 
  - neutral sidechain, implicit hydrogen at &epsilon;-nitrogen
  <li><b>both</b>
   - positive sidechain, implicitly protonated at both sidechain nitrogens
  </ul>
<li><b>Specified individually...</b> 
the desired protonation state of each histidine residue
will be specified with checkboxes in the dialog
</ul>
Clicking <b>Apply</b> (or <b>OK</b>, which also dismisses the dialog)
calculates the electrostatic potential and applies the coloring.
</p><p>
The calculation requires charge assignments, which in turn require hydrogens.
An existing structure lacking hydrogens is not changed, 
but a copy is created in memory, <a href="../addh/addh.html">protonated</a>,
and <a href="../addcharge/addcharge.html">assigned charges</a>
(<a href="../addcharge/addcharge.html#standard">details</a>),
which are then transferred to the existing structure.  Where hydrogens 
are missing from the existing structure, their charges are collapsed
onto the adjacent heavy atom.
</p><p>
<b>Pre-existing hydrogens and/or charges</b>.
A structure may already have explicit hydrogens, or they can be added
beforehand with <a href="../addh/addh.html"><b>AddH</b></a>.  Note
surfaces are more rugged (have more small bumps) for structures with hydrogens.
A structure may also have pre-existing charge assignments, such as from
<a href="../addcharge/addcharge.html"><b>Add Charge</b></a> or a previous
use of <b>Coulombic Surface Coloring</b>.
If all of the atoms corresponding to the chosen surface already have
charges, those values will be used rather than assigned anew, 
with the exception: changing a setting in the
<a href="#hisprot"><b>Implicit Histidine Protonation</b></a> section 
indicates that existing charges on those atoms should be erased 
and charges assigned anew when <b>Apply</b> or <b>OK</b> is clicked.
</p><p>
<b>Create corresponding color key</b> opens the
<a href="../2dlabels/2dlabels.html#colorkey"><b>Color Key</b></a> dialog
and populates it with the current colors and values;
a color key can then be created interactively with the mouse.
</p><p>
<b>Close</b> simply dismisses the dialog, while
<b>Help</b> opens this manual page in a browser window.

<h4>LIMITATIONS</h4></a>
<p>
<b>Subsequent coloring operations may erase surface custom colors</b>. 
Unless explicitly limited to non-surface items, subsequent use of
<a href="../../UsersGuide/menu.html#actcolor"><b>Actions... Color</b></a>
or the command <a href="../../UsersGuide/midas/color.html"><b>color</b></a>
on the molecule model corresponding to a
<a href="../../UsersGuide/representation.html#surfaces">molecular surface</a>
will reset the surface's color source to <b>atoms</b> and wipe out 
the Coulombic potential colors.  The custom surface coloring
will be erased even when only parts of the molecule model 
that do not contribute to the molecular surface are recolored.
</p>
<p>
<b>Subsequent recomputation of the molecular surface erases custom colors</b>. 
Anything that triggers surface recalculation, 
such as deleting atoms from the molecule model or changing certain 
<a href="../../UsersGuide/msmsattrib.html">molecular surface parameters</a>, 
will erase the Coulombic potential colors.  
</p>
<p>
<b>Surface caps not colored</b>.
This tool does not color
<a href="../surfcapper/surfcapper.html">caps</a>
on <a href="../../UsersGuide/clipping.html">clipped</a> surfaces.
