<h3>ReadStdin <img src="stdicon.png" alt="ReadStdin icon"></h3>
<p>
<b>ReadStdin</b> allows entry of
<a href="../../UsersGuide/framecommand.html" target="_top">Chimera commands</a>
through standard input (<i>stdin</i>).  Messages in response are sent to
standard output (<i>stdout</i>).
</p><p>
Independent of <b>ReadStdin</b>, however, if Chimera is started in
<a href="../../UsersGuide/options.html#nogui">nogui mode</a> 
without command/script file input,
a prompt will be supplied in the system shell for entering
<a href="../../UsersGuide/framecommand.html" target="_top">Chimera commands</a> 
on standard input.
</p><p>
There are <a href="../../UsersGuide/extension.html">several ways to start</a>
<b>ReadStdin</b>, a tool in the <b>Utilities</b> category.
After <b>ReadStdin</b> has been started, text from <i>stdin</i> will be
interpreted as Chimera <a href="../../UsersGuide/framecommand.html"
target="_top">commands</a>. Messages resulting from the execution
of those commands will be sent to <i>stdout</i> instead of the
<a href="../../UsersGuide/reply.html"><b>Reply Log</b></a>
(although certain messages that require an answer will still raise a dialog).
</p><p>
Each command string entered via <i>stdin</i> will be echoed to <i>stdout</i>
with "CMD " appended at the front.  Messages resulting from execution
of the command will be sent to <i>stdout</i>, followed by "END" to
denote the end of output for that command.  End-of-output signaling 
is useful for synchronizing an outside program with Chimera.
<b>ReadStdin</b> can be halted with an end-of-file character (Ctrl-d
on Unix).
<p><p>
Messages resulting from operations performed with the menu, 
graphical interfaces, or commands entered directly in the 
<a href="../../UsersGuide/chimerawindow.html#emulator"><b>Command Line</b></a>
will still be sent to the
<a href="../../UsersGuide/reply.html"><b>Reply Log</b></a>, not <i>stdout</i>.
