<h3>Surface Zone <img src="surfzoneicon.png" alt="Surface Zone icon"></h3>
<p>
<b>Surface Zone</b> restricts the display of
<a href="../../UsersGuide/surfattrib.html#surfmodels">surface models</a>
and their <a href="../surfcapper/surfcapper.html">caps</a>
to zones around <a href="../../UsersGuide/selection.html">selected</a> atoms
or <a href="../volumepathtracer/framevolpath.html" target="_top">markers</a>.
For <a href="../volumeviewer/framevolumeviewer.html" target="_top"><b>Volume 
Viewer</b></a> surfaces, the
<a href="../volumeviewer/volumeviewer.html#zone"><b>Zone</b> feature</a>
in the volume dialog is more efficient; it limits contouring calculations 
to the region containing the zone.
<b>Surface Zone</b> information is included in saved
<a href="../../UsersGuide/sessions.html#sesdef">sessions</a>.
See also: <a href="../colorzone/colorzone.html"><b>Color Zone</b></a>
</p><p>
There are <a href="../../UsersGuide/extension.html">several ways to start</a>
<b>Surface Zone</b>, a tool in the <b>Surface/Binding Analysis</b> category.
The <b>Surface</b> of interest should be chosen from the list of
available surface models.  Surfaces from
<a href="../multiscale/framemulti.html" target="_top"><b>Multiscale
Models</b></a> will be named for the PDB file from which 
the surfaces were generated.  
</p><p>
Clicking <b>Zone</b> limits the display of the chosen surface
to areas within a specified distance (<b>Radius</b>) of any
<a href="../../UsersGuide/selection.html">selected</a> atoms.
Surfaces are composed of triangles; only triangles with all three
vertices in the zone will be shown.
</p><p>
By default, a zone is based only on distances to any
<a href="../../UsersGuide/selection.html">selected</a> atoms
(and <a href="../volumepathtracer/framevolpath.html" target="_top"><b>Volume
Tracer</b></a> markers);
the <a href="../../UsersGuide/midas/bondzone.html"><b>bondzone</b></a>
command indicates that points along any
<a href="../../UsersGuide/selection.html">selected</a> bonds
(and <a href="../volumepathtracer/framevolpath.html" target="_top"><b>Volume
Tracer</b></a> links) should also be used.
</p><p>
The <b>Radius</b> can be adjusted by moving the slider or by typing in a 
new value.  There is no way to use different radii for different atoms.
Although the maximum radius attainable by moving the slider is 30.0, 
larger values can be typed.  If the set of selected atoms is
changed, <b>Zone</b> must be clicked again to move the zone accordingly.
Otherwise, the zone will remain centered on the formerly selected atoms.
Clicking
<b>Zone</b> will not update the surface display when no atoms are selected.
</p><p>
Clicking <b>No Zone</b> unlimits the display of the chosen surface model 
(shows the entire surface).  
</p><p>
<b>Close</b> dismisses the dialog, and
<b>Help</b> opens this manual page in a browser window.
