<h3>JEvTrace File Formats</h3>
<p>
<b>Sequence coloring format (SCF)</b> and <b>seqsel</b>
refer to types of files written by
<a href="http://www.cmpharm.ucsf.edu/~marcinj/JEvTrace/index.html"
target="_top">JEvTrace</a>: 
<blockquote>
"<a href="http://www.genomebiology.com/2002/3/12/research/0077" target="_top">
JEvTrace:  refinement and variations of the evolutionary trace in JAVA</a>,"
M. P. Joachimiak and F. E. Cohen, <i>Genome Biology</i>, <b>3(12)</b> (2002).
</blockquote>
There are <a href="#older">older</a> and <a href="#newer">newer</a>
versions of the format;
both contain information for coloring regions in sequence alignments
and in any associated structures using
<a href="multalignviewer.html#seqsel"><b>Multalign Viewer</b></a>.
</p><p>
In the <a name="older"><b><i>older format</i></b></a>,
each line indicates the position of the residue in the alignment
(not necessarily the same as its sequence number) to
be colored (actually <b>position minus one</b>),
the <b>number of the sequence</b> in which it should be colored
(0 means all sequences in the alignment),
and the <b>red, green, and blue components of the color</b>,
each on a scale from 0 to 255.  Example:
<blockquote><pre>
337    0      0     0   255
340    1      0   255   255
338    9    255   255     0
</pre></blockquote>
Columns are separated by spaces and do not need to be aligned.
The first line indicates that the residues at the 338th position in the
alignment in all of the sequences should be colored blue.  The second line
indicates that the residue at position 341 of the alignment
in the first (top) sequence should be colored cyan.  The third line
indicates that the residue at position 339 of the alignment
in the 9th sequence should be colored yellow.
</p><p>
The format accomodates any 24-bit digital color and allows
any subset of residues in any subset of sequences to be highlighted.
The residue/coloring information is
ordered hierarchically, <i>i.e.</i>, smallest to largest sequence ID,
and within this grouping, smallest to largest sequence position,
and within this grouping, smallest to largest color values.
This formula for sorting entries makes the data easier to read.
Importantly, only the positions to be colored are encoded,
minimizing disk space usage and maximizing the speed at which the
information can be read.
</p><p>
The <a name="newer"><b><i>newer format</i></b></a>
is similar to the <a href="#older">older format</a>,
but allows easier specification of residue and sequence ranges.
Example:
<blockquote><pre>
8    8    -1     -1    0   255   255      //
8    8    9     9    255   175   175      //
8    8    10     10    255   175   175      //
</pre></blockquote>
The first two fields in each line indicate a range of positions
in the alignment, <b>starting position minus one</b> and <b>ending
position minus one</b>.
The next two fields indicate a range of sequences in the alignment,
<b>starting sequence</b> and <b>ending sequence</b>; 0 means all sequences,
while -1 means the line is for internal use by JEvTrace (and will
be ignored by <a href="multalignviewer.html#seqsel"><b>Multalign 
Viewer</b></a>).  The next three fields specify
the <b>red, green, and blue components of the color</b>,
each on a scale from 0 to 255.
In the example, a pinkish color is specified for the ninth position in
the alignment within the ninth and tenth sequences.
The last required field is either "<b>//</b>" or "<b>#</b>"
and may be followed by a comment.  If a comment is present, it is used as the
region name.  Lines in the SCF file with the same comment
are used to define a single region.
