<p>
<b>Constrained Move</b> provides mouse modes for rotation and translation
relative to axes defined in a model's frame of reference.
Such manipulations are helpful for aligning structures with an
axis of symmetry.  There are <a href="../../UsersGuide/extension.html">
several ways to start</a> <b>Constrained Move</b>,
a tool in the <b>Movement</b> category.

<b>Constrain mouse rotations</b> reassigns the button currently
assigned to rotation to constrained rotation.  Likewise,
<b>Constrain mouse translations</b> reassigns the button currently
assigned to XY translation to constrained translation.
Deactivating these options restores the previous rotation/translation
behavior.
</p><p>
It is possible to have different buttons assigned to a constrained motion
and the corresponding unconstrained motion at the same time.
Buttons can be reassigned using the
<a href="../../UsersGuide/preferences.html#Mouse"><b>Mouse</b> preferences</a>.
The constrained mouse modes are not shown in the preferences panel unless
<b>Constrained Move</b> has been started.
</p>

<h4><a name="axes">AXIS DEFINITION</a></h4>
<p>
Different axes can be used for rotation and translation.
The three values in the <b>Axis</b> field specify direction.
Clicking <b>x</b>, <b>y</b>, or <b>z</b>
sets the direction along the reference model's X, Y, or Z axis,
directions (1 0 0), (0 1 0), or (0 0 1), respectively.
Any three values can be entered, however, and should be separated
by spaces, with no commas or parentheses.
</p><p>
An axis for <b><i>rotation</i></b>
is defined by a direction and an anchor point,
or <b>Origin</b>.  Clicking <b>zero</b> sets the <b>Origin</b> to (0 0 0),
while clicking <b>center</b> sets it to the center of the bounding box
of the reference model.  Only a direction is needed to constrain
<b><i>translation</i></b>.
</p><p>
It is not necessary to turn off constrained modes before changing
the reference model, an axis definition, or whether translation
should be parallel or perpendicular to the specified axis.
