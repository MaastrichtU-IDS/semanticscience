<p>
These input files can be gzipped.
</p><p>
The PDB options generally require coordinates for the same set of atoms to be 
supplied for each frame.  However, if the coordinates supplied for a 
frame represent only a subset of the atoms in the preceding frame, 
it will be inferred that the remaining atoms are present but have the
same coordinates as in the preceding frame.  Changes are cumulated
in the forward direction and based on all frames, even when frames
are skipped during playback (<a href="#step">step size</a> &gt; 1).
<p>
All or a contiguous subsegment of a trajectory can be loaded.
<a name="pipe">
If <b>pipe</b> is entered as the ending frame number</a>, 
the input trajectory will be read until it runs out, 
as long as no other input specifies a smaller ending frame number.  
For example, for a GROMOS trajectory,
the NSTLIM variable in the PROMD file should also be increased to at least
the total number of frames expected.  When a pipe has been specified,
there will be an attempt to load the entire trajectory up front.
</p><p>
A further option is a <a name="metafile"><b>metafile</b></a>, 
simply a text file that specifies the input files/parameters.
The first line designates trajectory type 
(such as <b>amber</b> or <b>gromos</b>, where case is unimportant)
and optionally,
starting and ending frame numbers of the range to be loaded.
A pipe can be specified as described <a href="#pipe">above</a>.
If no frame numbers are supplied, the entire trajectory will be loaded;
however, if "?" is given for both the starting and ending frame numbers,
a dialog for entering this information will appear.  
The remaining lines specify input files and
parameters in the same order as in the dialog.  For example:
<blockquote><pre>
amber 500 1000
dna.prmtop
dna.mdcrd
</pre></blockquote>
or:
<blockquote><pre>
pdb
single
108d.pdb
</pre></blockquote>
If input files are not in the same directory as the metafile,
their pathnames relative to the location of the metafile should be supplied.
A metafile can be opened directly from the 
<a href="../../UsersGuide/chimerawindow.html#emulator"><b>Command Line</b></a>
(or the system command line upon <a href="../../UsersGuide/startup.html">
startup</a>) using the prefix <b>md:</b> or <b>movie:</b>.  This will
start <b>MD Movie</b> and open the trajectory data.
</p>

<a name="viewing">
<h4>VIEWING FRAMES</h4>
</a>
<p>
After input files and parameters have been specified,
the first set of coordinates will be displayed and 
the <a name="controller"><b>MD Movie</b> controller</a> will appear:
</p>
<table align="right"><tr><td>
<img src="movie2.png" alt="MD Movie controller">
</td></tr></table>
<p>
If a subsegment was specified, a message about the
restricted frame range will be displayed temporarily. 
The total number of frames in the trajectory (whether loaded or not)
will continue to be reported.  
<a name="framesread">
For all <a href="#movieinput">input formats</a> except PDB,
the coordinates for a given frame are not read in
until that frame is viewed or used for analysis.
</a>
</p><p>
From left to right, the buttons mean: play backward continuously;
go back one <a href="#step">step</a>; stop; 
go forward one <a href="#step">step</a>; 
and play forward continuously.  When the <b>Loop</b>
option is on, forward play can wrap from the end to the beginning
of the loaded trajectory and reverse play can wrap from the beginning
to the end.  
<a name="delay">The rate of continuous play can be adjusted</a> 
with the <b>Playback speed</b> slider; up to a 1-second delay
can be added between frame advances.
The <b>Frame</b> number is reported and can also be entered
directly to view a specific frame.  The <a name="step"><b>Step size</b></a>
controls the level of sampling for viewing purposes. For example, 
a step size of 3 indicates that only every third frame will be viewed;
however, when forward play loops from end to beginning, the movie will
start at the first frame loaded, and when reverse play loops from beginning 
to end, the movie will start at the last frame loaded.
Frame number and step size changes take effect when
return (<b>Enter</b>) is pressed.
</p><p>
Protein secondary structure assignments are not recomputed automatically 
over the course of a trajectory.  If displaying protein as a
<a href="../../UsersGuide/representation.html#ribbon">ribbon</a>,
see the <a href="#ssnote">note</a> below.
</p><p>
The current frame or all frames that have been viewed
can be saved as a PDB file with
<a href="#moviefile"><b>File... Save PDB</b></a>.
The view can be <a href="#steady">held steady</a> on
<a href="../../UsersGuide/selection.html">selected</a> atoms.

to be executed at each frame update.

<a name="recording">
<h4>RECORDING A MOVIE</h4>
</a>
<p>
Images can be captured during 
trajectory playback and automatically assembled into a movie file.
Manipulations in Chimera can be performed and 
<a href="#per-frame">per-frame scripts</a> executed
during the playback/image-saving process.

<ul>
Important notes:
<a name="ssnote">
<li>Protein secondary structure assignments are not recomputed automatically 
over the course of a trajectory.</a>
If a protein or peptide is displayed as a
<a href="../../UsersGuide/representation.html#ribbon">ribbon</a> 
and significant conformational changes are occurring, users may want to
reassign secondary structure at each frame.   
This can be done with a <a href="#per-frame">per-frame script</a>
that includes the Chimera command 
<a href="../../UsersGuide/midas/ksdssp.html"><b>ksdssp</b></a>.
<li>For a one-to-one relationship between trajectory frames and 
recorded image frames, the <a href="#delay"><b>Playback speed</b></a> slider
should be moved to the far right.  Otherwise, identical image frames 
will be inserted between the unique data frames to slow playback.
The frame number parameters described below refer only
to the unique data frames.
<li>On certain platforms, other windows should not overlap
the Chimera graphics window during recording 
(<a href="../../UsersGuide/print.html#exception">details...</a>).
This is not an issue when <a href="#raytrace">raytracing</a> is used.
</ul>
<a href="#moviefile"><b>File... Record movie</b></a>

parameters:  
<ul>
<li><b>File name</b> - name for the resulting movie file
<li><b>File type</b> (movie format) choices:
  <ul>
  <li> MPEG-1 [.mpg]
  <li> MPEG-2 [.mpg]
  <li> MPEG-4 [.mp4]
  <li> AVI MSMPEG-4v2 [.avi]
  <li> Quicktime [.mov]
  </ul>
<li><b>Starting frame</b> (first frame loaded, by default) 
- number of the first frame at which to save an image
<li><a name="moviesamp"><b>Step size [<i>n</i>]</b></a>
- level of sampling within the indicated range 
 (every <i>n</i><sup>th</sup> frame will be used)
<li><b>Ending frame</b> (last frame loaded, by default) 
- number of the last frame to possibly include (if not skipped by sampling);
must be within the range originally loaded
<li><b>Encode forward then backward ("roundtrip")</b> (true/<b>false</b>)
- whether to include the frames in reverse order as the second half
  of the movie
<li><a name="supersample"><b>Frame quality</b></a> (screen/<b>supersampled</b>)
- whether to increase the image quality over what is displayed on the screen.
  The <b>supersampled</b> option 
  (even with 1x1 <a href="#samples">sampling</a>) allows the
  <a href="../../UsersGuide/sideview.html#subqual">subdivision quality</a> to 
  be <a href="../../UsersGuide/sideview.html#subup">adjusted automatically</a>.
<li><a name="samples"><b>Samples</b></a> (1x1/2x2/<b>3x3</b>/4x4/5x5/6x6)
- When <a href="#supersample">supersampling</a>, how many pixels 
  to sample in the X and Y dimensions for each pixel in the final saved image.
  Supersampling at levels greater than 1x1  entails generating initial images
  larger than the window and sampling them down to the final size.
  Higher values increase smoothness but also calculation time.
<li><a name="raytrace"><b>Raytrace with POV-Ray</b></a> (true/<b>false</b>)
- whether to <a href="../../UsersGuide/raytracing.html">raytrace with

with a default constant bit rate and buffer size, and image frames
will be deleted after the movie has been encoded
</ul>
Clicking <b>Record</b> plays the trajectory and saves image frames
according to the specified starting and ending points and step values.
The resulting set of images will be converted to a movie file.
Stopping playback with the

<a name="per-frame">
<h4>PER-FRAME SCRIPTS</h4>
</a>
<p>
<a href="#movieperframe"><b>Per-Frame... Define script</b></a> allows
specification of a script to be executed at each trajectory frame.
Scripts can be written in <a href="../../UsersGuide/framecommand.html"
target="_top">Chimera commands</a> or Python code, and can
incorporate trajectory frame numbers.
Python scripts can also access the molecule model instance.  
<p><p>
Examples:
<ul>
<li>the following Chimera command script 
(<a href="eachFrame.com" type="text/plain">eachFrame.com</a>)
identifies hydrogen bonds at each frame and shows only the residues involved:
<pre>
<a href="../../UsersGuide/midas/chain.html">chain</a> @ca
<a href="../../UsersGuide/midas/display.html">~disp</a> solvent
<a href="../../UsersGuide/midas/hbonds.html">hb</a> line 2 color yellow reveal true
</pre>
Commands to be executed only at a specific frame can be indicated 
with a leading #<i>frame_num</i>: (for example, <b>#50:</b>) 
that will be stripped before the command is executed.
<br><br>
<li>the following Python script
(<a href="specificFrames.py" type="text/plain">specificFrames.py</a>)
initiates events at specific frames:
<pre>
from chimera import runCommand
frame = mdInfo['frame']
if frame == mdInfo['startFrame']:
        runCommand("<a href="../../UsersGuide/midas/roll.html">roll</a> y 3 40")
elif frame == 10:
        runCommand("<a href="../../UsersGuide/midas/color.html">color</a> green")
elif frame == 50:
        runCommand("<a href="../../UsersGuide/midas/color.html">color</a> orange")
        runCommand("<a href="../../UsersGuide/midas/rlabel.html">rl</a> :ala; <a href="../../UsersGuide/midas/color.html">color</a> dodger blue :ala; <a href="../../UsersGuide/midas/represent.html">rep</a> stick :ala")
elif frame == 90:
        runCommand("<a href="../../UsersGuide/midas/rlabel.html">~rl</a>; <a href="../../UsersGuide/midas/represent.html">rep</a> wire :ala")
else:
        runCommand("<a href="../../UsersGuide/midas/color.html">color</a> byhet")
</pre>
</ul>
For Python scripts, the chimera module is automatically imported.
</p><p>
<b>Note</b>:
Frame arguments in commands such as 
<a href="../../UsersGuide/midas/roll.html"><b>roll</b></a> refer to 
<b><i>image frames</i></b> rather than to unique data (trajectory) frames.
For a one-to-one correspondence between image and trajectory frames,
the <a href="#delay"><b>Playback speed</b></a> slider must be positioned 
all the way to the right and the viewing step size set to 1.
Whereas an <b>MD Movie</b> per-frame script executes at each trajectory frame, 
commands to be executed at each image frame (independent of any trajectory)
can be specified with the
<a href="../../UsersGuide/midas/perframe.html"><b>perframe</b></a> command.
<p><p>
<b>Insert text file</b> allows browsing to a text file and placing its contents
in the script area. <b>Save to file</b> saves the current contents of
the script area to a text file. 
</p><p>
<b>OK</b> and <b>Apply</b> execute the script with and without
closing the dialog, respectively.  If the movie is playing, the
script will continue to be executed for each trajectory frame until
<a href="#movieperframe"><b>Stop running script</b></a> is chosen;
if the movie is halted on a single frame, the script will be executed
for that frame and will not be executed again until a different frame is shown.
<b>Clear</b> deletes the contents of the script area.  <b>Close</b>
closes the dialog without executing the script, and <b>Help</b> opens
this manual page in a browser window.

<a name="occupancy">
<h4>OCCUPANCY ANALYSIS</h4>
</a>
<p>
It may be interesting to see which regions of space are highly populated 
by certain atoms relative to others in the trajectory or ensemble.
For example, cations or water hydrogens may tend to occupy space
around a negatively charged solute group.  
Occupancies can be represented as a three-dimensional grid of values,
or <b><i>volume data</i></b>.
<a href="#movieanal"><b>Analysis... Calculate occupancy</b></a> 
can be used to generate such data and display it with
<a href="../volumeviewer/framevolumeviewer.html" target="_top"><b>Volume
Viewer</b></a>. 
The occupancy map can be <a href="#saveocc">saved to a file</a> and later
reopened in Chimera.
</p><p>
Usually, one should first define a reference set of atoms
to hold steady (the trajectory frames will be transformed to keep
these atoms in the same place and orientation, as much as possible).
This is accomplished by 
<a href="../../UsersGuide/selection.html">selecting</a> 
the desired reference atoms and then choosing 
<a href="#movieactions"><b>Actions... Hold selection steady</b></a>.  
When the <a href="../../UsersGuide/selection.html">selection</a> 
is later changed, the "hold steady" atoms will not change unless 
<a href="#movieactions"><b>Actions... Hold selection steady</b></a>
is used again.
</p><p>
Next, one should <a href="../../UsersGuide/selection.html">select</a>
the atoms for which occupancy data will be collected.  The
atoms in the <a href="../../UsersGuide/selection.html">selection</a>
can be combined into a single set of occupancy data, or 
<a href="#separate">segregated</a>
by <a href="../../UsersGuide/idatm.html">atom type</a>.
<ul>

 (every <i>n</i><sup>th</sup> frame will be used)
<li><b>Ending frame</b> (last frame loaded, by default) 
- number of the last frame to possibly include (if not skipped by sampling);
must be within the range originally loaded
<li><a name="limit"><b>Limit data collection to within cutoff distance of

the atom type symbol is enclosed in brackets and appended to the name.
<li><a name="separate"><b>Collect data separately for each atom type

</ul>
<b>OK</b> collects occupancy data for the

The resulting data grid(s) are displayed with
<a href="../volumeviewer/framevolumeviewer.html" target="_top"><b>Volume

The dimensions of an occupancy grid will be the smallest
needed to enclose any nonzero values (which could be smaller than the 
<a href="#limit">region of data collection</a>).

The calculations may require
additional frames to be read (frames within the loaded range
are not actually read until viewed or otherwise used)
and may take several minutes, depending on the size of the system
and the number of frames.  The <b>Abort</b> button on the RMSD map dialog
allows termination of a calculation in progress.
</p><p>
The following approaches are recommended for examining long trajectories
or long trajectory segments:
<ul>
<li>using sparser <a href="#rmsdsamp">sampling</a>
<li>limiting the calculation to fewer atoms, such as the backbone only;
the calculation can be limited by

<a href="#thresholds">threshold settings</a>.
When the cursor is placed over a map,
the corresponding frame numbers and RMSD value are given near the
bottom of the dialog.  Clicking on a map places the corresponding 
frame numbers in the <b>Frame</b> fields.  Clicking <b>Go</b> changes
the graphics display to the corresponding frame.
</p><p>
Alternatively, the
<a href="../ensemblematch/ensemblematch.html"><b>Ensemble Match</b></a> tool
can be used to calculate all-by-all pairwise RMSD values for an ensemble
read from a single PDB file.  The file would need to be
<a href="../../UsersGuide/filetypes.html">opened in a standard way</a>
rather than with <b>MD Movie</b>.  Unlike <b>MD Movie</b>,
<a href="../ensemblematch/ensemblematch.html"><b>Ensemble Match</b></a> 
can perform the corresponding pairwise superpositions (<i>i.e.</i>
match one structure to another), but its use is impractical for
ensembles with very many members.

<h4>ADDING A FORMAT</h4>
</a>
<p>
<b>MD Movie</b> uses the Trajectory module to read the various formats
(<b><i>chimera</i>/share/Trajectory</b>, where <b><i>chimera</i></b>
is the Chimera installation location). <b>Trajectory</b>
contains a subdirectory, <b>formats</b>, which in turn contains 
subdirectories that each correspond to the Python module for a 
supported format. By convention, the module (and directory)
name for each format is the name of the format with the first letter of 
each word capitalized and all other letters lowercase.  For example,
the MMTK module's name is <b>Mmtk</b>.
</p><p>
A format's module is typically structured so that the code that 
interfaces with Trajectory's generic format handling is in
<a href="#initfile"><b>__init__.py</b></a>, 
and the code specific to reading a particular format is in
<a href="#specificfile">another python file</a>,
usually named after the format itself (for example, <b>Gromos.py</b>).
</p><p>
<a name="initfile"><b>__init__.py</b></a> must support the following:
<ul>
<li>If the format name displayed to the user should be different
from the module name (usually it should, due to capitalization), then 
there must be a global variable named <var>formatName</var> that is 
initialized to the display name of the format.

<li>A class named <var>ParamGUI</var> must be defined 
to handle presenting the file-loading interface to the user.
It must have two methods:
 <ul>
   <li><var>__init__</var>, which receives a <var>Tkinter.Frame</var>
instance argument.  The <var>__init__</var> method should populate the frame
with widgets for gathering the input information for the format from the user.

   <li><var>loadEnsemble</var>, which takes as arguments 
a starting frame number, ending frame number, and callback function.
<var>loadEnsemble</var> needs to compose a list of the arguments 
that were provided by the user to the widgets defined in 
<var>__init__</var>, and then call this module's 
global <var>loadEnsemble</var> function (see below) with that list as the first 
argument and the start/end frame number and callback as the remaining 
three arguments.
  </ul>
<li> A global <var>loadEnsemble</var> 
function that generates an <var>ensemble</var> instance 
(discussed later).  This function is not only called by the 
<var>ParamGUI.loadEnsemble</var> method, but also when
a <a href="#metafile">metafile</a> is used to specify the input parameters.  
This function takes four arguments:  
a format-specific list of input parameters, a starting frame number, 
an ending frame number, and a callback function to start the <b>MD Movie</b> 
interface.  The global <var>loadEnsemble</var> function
should call the interface with the generated ensemble 
as an argument, and should remember the provided 
format-specific values as preferred defaults for 
future uses of the format.
</ul>
<b>__init__.py</b> files are very similar from format to format.
The simplest way to generate a new <b>__init__.py</b> file
is to copy and modify another format's.
Gromos format provides a good example, as it
involves multiple input files and a non-file parameter.
</p><p>
The <a name="specificfile"><b>format-specific .py file</b></a>
defines an <var>ensemble</var> class that gets instantiated from 
<b>__init__.py</b>'s <var>loadEnsemble</var> function.  
The <var>ensemble</var> class must support the following methods:
<ul>
<li> An <var>__init__</var> method that takes the format's input parameters and 
start/end frames as arguments.  The <var>__init__</var> method may read input 
files or do whatever is necessary to support the other instance methods 
(such as call into a C/C++ module to read the files, as is done for
Amber format).

<li> A <var>GetDict</var> method that takes a string argument.  The string 
specifies what data should be returned.  The possible string values are:
  <ul>
  <li> <var>atomnames</var> - return a list of the atom names; a residue's 
atoms must be consecutive
  <li> <var>elements</var> - return a list of the atom elements.  These should 
be instances of <var>chimera.Element</var> 
(which can be initialized with a string such as "Fe" or a number).
Trajectory's <var>determineElementFromMass</var>
function may be useful if the format does not specify the atomic 
number directly or it cannot be determined easily from the atom name.
  <li> <var>resnames</var> - return a list of the residue names
  <li> <var>bonds</var> - return a list of bonds (2-tuples of indices into 
the <var>atomnames</var> list)
  <li> <var>ipres</var> - a list of the first atom of each residue (indices 
into <var>atomnames</var>, but unlike previous indices these are 
1-based, so the first element of <var>ipres</var> will always be 1)
  </ul>
<li> A <var>__getitem__</var> method taking a frame-number argument 
(starting with 1):  return a list of 3-tuples corresponding to the 
xyz coordinates of the atoms in that frame 
(in the same order as <var>atomnames</var>).  
The coordinates should be in angstroms.

<li> A <var>__len__</var> method that returns the total number of 
frames in the trajectory (not just the number of frames between the 
user-specified start/end frames).
</ul>
