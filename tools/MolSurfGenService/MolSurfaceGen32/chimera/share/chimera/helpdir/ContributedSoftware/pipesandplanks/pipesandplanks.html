<b>PipesAndPlanks</b> creates a VRML representation of 
protein secondary structure in which helices are shown as "pipes"
(cylinders) and strands are shown as "planks."
Protein helix and strand assignments are taken from the input structure
file or generated with
<a href="../../UsersGuide/midas/ksdssp.html"><b>ksdssp</b></a>.
Segments other than helices or strands are treated as turns 
(even though they may not be defined as such in the input file).
<b>PipesAndPlanks</b> does not work for
nonprotein molecules such as nucleic acids.

<a href="../structuremeas/structuremeas.html#axes"><b>Axes/Planes</b></a>
</p><p>
There are <a href="../../UsersGuide/extension.html">several ways to start</a>
<b>PipesAndPlanks</b>, a tool in the <b>Depiction</b> category.
Starting <b>PipesAndPlanks</b> opens a dialog box.
The model of interest should be chosen from the pulldown list
of open molecule models (indicated by the black inverted triangle near
the top of the dialog).
</p><p>
<b>Helix color</b>, <b>Strand color</b>, and <b>Turn color</b> assignments 
can be changed by clicking the respective 
<a href="../../UsersGuide/coloring.html#colorwell">color well</a>.
<b>Helix radius</b>, <b>Strand width</b>, <b>Strand thickness</b>,
<b>Turn width</b>, and <b>Turn thickness</b> parameters are in angstroms.
If <b>Fixed</b> [<b>helix radius</b>, <b>strand width</b>, 
or <b>strand thickness</b>] is <b>false</b>,
the specified value is ignored and the parameter instead depends on
the distances from the constituent alpha-carbons to the axis of the helix
or strand.  If the ratio of maximum to minimum distance from alpha-carbons
to the axis exceeds the [<b>Helix</b> or <b>Strand</b>] <b>split threshold</b> 
(and the corresponding <b>Split curved...</b> option is <b>true</b>), 
the pipe or plank will be split into two parts, each with its own axis.
</p><p>
Clicking <b>OK</b> creates the display and dismisses the dialog;
clicking <b>Apply</b> creates the display without dismissing the dialog.
The pipes-and-planks VRML representation is placed in the same model number
as the corresponding molecule.
It can be closed or hidden independently of the corresponding molecule model
with the <a href="../../UsersGuide/modelpanel.html"><b>Model Panel</b></a>,
or undisplayed/displayed (hidden/shown) with the command
<a href="../../UsersGuide/midas/objdisplay.html"><b>objdisplay</b></a>.
<b>Close</b> dismisses the dialog, and
<b>Help</b> opens this manual page in a browser window.
