<h3>Measure and Color Blobs
<img src="picksurficon.png" alt="Measure and Color Blobs icon"></h3>
<p>
<b>Measure and Color Blobs</b> enables coloring and measuring individual
disconnected parts, or <b><i>blobs</i></b>, within a
<a href="../../UsersGuide/surfattrib.html#surfmodels">surface model</a>.
Clicking a blob with the mouse changes it to the specified color 
and reports its surface area and enclosed volume.
To measure the model's <i>total</i> surface area and enclosed volume, use
<a href="../measurevol/measurevol.html"><b>Measure Volume and Area</b></a>
or the command <a href="../../UsersGuide/midas/measure.html"><b>measure</b></a>
instead.  These tools compute surface area and enclosed volume
from surface triangles rather than analytically.
</p><p>
Note that when a
<a href="../../UsersGuide/representation.html#surfaces">molecular
surface</a> is generated, the analytical solvent-accessible and 
solvent-excluded areas (total and for each disconnected component)
are automatically reported in the
<a href="../../UsersGuide/reply.html"><b>Reply Log</b></a>,
and the values per atom and residue are assigned as
<a href="../defineattrib/defineattrib.html#attribdef">attributes</a>
named <b>areaSAS</b> and <b>areaSES</b>.
</p><p>
There are <a href="../../UsersGuide/extension.html">several ways to start</a>
<b>Measure and Color Blobs</b>, a tool in the <b>Surface/Binding Analysis</b>
and <b>Volume Data</b> categories
(including from the <a href="../volumeviewer/framevolumeviewer.html"
target="_top"><b>Volume Viewer</b></a> <b>Tools</b> menu).
The dialog includes the options:
<ul>
<table align="right">
<tr><td><img src="pickmodeicon.png"></td></tr>
</table>
<li><b>Use mouse [<i>button</i>] to pick blobs</b> 
- which mouse button (1, 2, 3, Ctrl-1, Ctrl-2, or Ctrl-3)
will be used to pick surface blobs from the screen.
The icon representing this mouse mode in the
<a href="../../UsersGuide/preferences.html#Mouse"><b>Mouse</b> preferences</a>
is shown at right.
<li><b>Color blob</b> 
[<a href="../../UsersGuide/coloring.html#colorwell">color well</a>]
- color to apply to subsequently picked blobs
</ul>
Surfaces are composed of triangles.  When a blob is picked from the screen,
the exact area of its triangulated surface and the volume enclosed
are reported in the <b>Measure and Color Blobs</b> dialog, the
<a href="../../UsersGuide/chimerawindow.html#statusline">status line</a>,
and the <a href="../../UsersGuide/reply.html"><b>Reply Log</b></a>.
Values reflect the physical units of the data, usually
&Aring;<sup>3</sup> for volume and &Aring;<sup>2</sup> for area.
</p><p>
Anything that alters the positions of vertices in a surface,
such as <a href="../volumeviewer/volumeviewer.html#surf-options">smoothing</a>
the surface or changing its
<a href="../volumeviewer/volumeviewer.html#dispsurf">contour level</a>
in <a href="../volumeviewer/framevolumeviewer.html" 
target="_top"><b>Volume Viewer</b></a>,
will change its area and enclosed volume.  
</p><p>
The volume enclosed by a surface with holes is calculated by assuming
each hole has a planar cap.  These caps are not displayed or included in
the surface area determination.  The number of holes is reported, as
planar caps may not represent missing data very well.
<a href="../../ContributedSoftware/multiscale/framemulti.html" target="_top">
<b>Multiscale Models</b></a> surfaces should never have holes.
Holes in a contour surface from
<a href="../volumeviewer/framevolumeviewer.html" 
target="_top"><b>Volume Viewer</b></a> may occur at the boundary of the data, 
but by default these will already be covered with
<a href="../../ContributedSoftware/volumeviewer/volumeviewer.html#caphigh">
planar caps</a>.  Such boundary caps will be included in 
the surface area calculation and will not be reported as holes.
</p><p>
While <b>Measure and Color Blobs</b> acts on a single disconnected blob at a time,
<a href="../measurevol/measurevol.html"><b>Measure Volume and Area</b></a>
reports the total area and enclosed volume for a surface model even if
comprised of multiple disconnected blobs.
</p>

<a name="limitations">
<h4>LIMITATIONS</h4>
</a>
<p>
Colors applied with <b>Measure and Color Blobs</b> are lost when the surface 
contour level is changed.
</p><p>
Any mouse buttons assigned to pick blobs are not automatically
reassigned to their previous functions; the
<a href="../../UsersGuide/preferences.html#Mouse"><b>Mouse</b> preferences</a>
must be used to reassign them.
