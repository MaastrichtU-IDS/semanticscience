<h3>Task Panel
<img src="task.png" alt="Task Panel icon"></h3>
<p>
The <b>Task Panel</b> is an interface to jobs started by Chimera. 
It provides information on previous and currently running jobs and 
allows canceling background tasks.
</p><p>
There are <a href="../../UsersGuide/extension.html">several ways to start</a>
the <b>Task Panel</b>, a tool in the <b>General Controls</b> category,
including clicking the information icon 
<img src="../../UsersGuide/taskicon.png"> in the
<a href="../../UsersGuide/chimerawindow.html#statusline">status line</a>.  
The icon will be grayed out when no background jobs are running, 
but clicking it will still show the <b>Task Panel</b>.
</p><p>
<b>Clear Finished</b> removes listings of any canceled or finished jobs.
<b>Help</b> opens this manual page in a browser window,
and <b>Close</b> dismisses the dialog.
