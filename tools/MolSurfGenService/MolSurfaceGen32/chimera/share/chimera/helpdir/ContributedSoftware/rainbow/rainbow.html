<h3>Rainbow <img src="rainbowicon.png" alt="Rainbow icon"></h3>
<p>
<b>Rainbow</b> uses a range of colors, changing the color per residue, 
chain, or molecule model.
There are <a href="../../UsersGuide/extension.html">several ways to start</a>
<b>Rainbow</b>, a tool in the <b>Depiction</b> category.
It is also implemented as the command
<a href="../../UsersGuide/midas/rainbow.html"><b>rainbow</b></a>.
</p><p>
Individual models or blocks of models 
can be chosen from the <b>Models</b> list with the left mouse button.  
Ctrl-click toggles the status of an individual model.
To choose a block of models without dragging,
click on the first (or last) and then Shift-click 
on the last (or first) in the desired block.
</p><p>
Options for coloring the chosen molecule models are to
<b>Change color every</b>:
<ul>
<li><b>residue</b> (starting over for each chain) 
<li><b>chain</b> (starting over for each model, where
 "model" indicates a submodel or a model 
 that is not subdivided into submodels)
<li><b>model</b> 
</ul>
<a href="../../UsersGuide/midas/atom_spec.html#chainassign">WATER 
and HET chains</a>
are not affected when the color is changed per residue or chain.
The coloring cannot be limited to subset of the residues in a chain
or a subset of the polymer chains in a model.
</p><p>
The <b>Color range</b> is defined by five 
<a href="../../UsersGuide/coloring.html#colorwell">color wells</a>,
corresponding to starting color, three intermediate interpolation
colors, and ending color.
The default colors are <b>blue</b>, <b>cyan</b>,
<b>green</b>, <b>yellow</b>, and <b>red</b>, in that order.
To use a different number of colors (two to four, or more than five)
to define the range, use the
<a href="../../UsersGuide/midas/rainbow.html"><b>rainbow</b></a> command
instead.
</p><p>
Apparent color is determined by a
<a href="../../UsersGuide/hierarchy.html">hierarchy</a>;
briefly, atom colors assigned on a per-atom
basis and ribbon colors assigned on a per-residue basis
override the model-level color. 
When coloring per residue or chain,
<b>Rainbow</b> sets individual atom colors and per-residue ribbon colors; 
when coloring per model, it sets model-level colors and removes 
any atom-level  and ribbon color assignments within the models.
</p><p>
<b>OK</b> performs the coloring and dismisses the dialog, whereas <b>Apply</b>
performs the coloring without dismissing the dialog.
<b>Defaults</b> restores the 
<a href="../../UsersGuide/coloring.html#colorwell">color wells</a>
to the default colors.
<b>Close</b> dismisses the dialog, and
<b>Help</b> opens this manual page in a browser window.
