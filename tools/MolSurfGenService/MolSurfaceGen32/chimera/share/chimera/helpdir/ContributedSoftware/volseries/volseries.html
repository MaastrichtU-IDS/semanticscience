<h3>Volume Series <img src="volseriesicon.png" alt="Volume Series icon"></h3>

<p>
<b>Volume Series</b> displays an ordered sequence of
<a href="../../UsersGuide/filetypes.html#volume">volume data</a> sets.
A sequence could represent a time series or a comparison of states
not necessarily ordered in time.  See also:
<a href="../morphmap/morphmap.html"><b>Morph Map</b></a>,
<a href="../../UsersGuide/movies.html">making movies</a>
</p><p>
There are <a href="../../UsersGuide/extension.html">several ways to start</a>
<b>Volume Series</b>, a tool in the <b>Volume Data</b> category
(including from the <a href="../volumeviewer/framevolumeviewer.html" 
target="_top"><b>Volume Viewer</b></a> <b>Tools</b> menu).
</p><p>
Clicking <b>Open...</b> raises a file browser for opening a volume series
as either of the following:
<ul>
<li>multiple 
<a href="../../UsersGuide/filetypes.html#volume">volume data</a> files
sorted by name
<li>a single
<a href="../../UsersGuide/filetypes.html#volumetime">volume series</a>
file in Priism time series format
</ul>
A Priism time series file can also be opened in
<a href="../../UsersGuide/filetypes.html">other ways</a>, which will
automatically start the <b>Volume Series</b> tool.
Opening a volume series of any type also starts
<a href="../volumeviewer/framevolumeviewer.html" 
target="_top"><b>Volume Viewer</b></a>. 
Each member of the series is treated as a separate set of data in
in <a href="../volumeviewer/framevolumeviewer.html" 
target="_top"><b>Volume Viewer</b></a>.
</p><p>
Multiple volume series may co-exist in Chimera.
A volume series is named after the single file it was read from, or the
first file if read from multiple files.
Choosing the name of a volume series from the <b>Data</b> listing 
switches the display to that series, and it can be closed with
<b>Close Series</b>.  Similarly, choosing <b>All</b> allows simultaneous
display or removal of all of the volume series in Chimera. 
</p><p>
<a name="time">
The members of a series are indexed 0, 1, 2, ... and these indices
are referred to as the <b>Time</b>.</a>
Any numbers in the individual filenames are not used, except to sort the names.
</p>

<a name="playback">
<h4>APPEARANCE AND PLAYBACK</h4></a>
<p>
The <b>Time</b> slider can be moved manually to show a particular set of data 
and make it the 
<a href="../../ContributedSoftware/volumeviewer/volumeviewer.html#currentset">
current set</a> of data in
<a href="../../ContributedSoftware/volumeviewer/framevolumeviewer.html"
target="_top"><b>Volume Viewer</b></a>.
Settings in 
<a href="../../ContributedSoftware/volumeviewer/framevolumeviewer.html"
target="_top"><b>Volume Viewer</b></a> 
(<a href="../../ContributedSoftware/volumeviewer/volumeviewer.html#display">display style</a>,
<a href="../../ContributedSoftware/volumeviewer/volumeviewer.html#datastep">step size</a>,
<a href="../../ContributedSoftware/volumeviewer/volumeviewer.html#threshcolor">threshold level/color</a>,
<a href="../../ContributedSoftware/volumeviewer/volumeviewer.html#surf-options">
surface smoothing</a>, 
<i>etc.</i>) control its appearance and will be applied automatically 
to other series members as they are displayed.
For efficient playback, however, the 
<a href="../../ContributedSoftware/volumeviewer/framevolumeviewer.html"
target="_top"><b>Volume Viewer</b></a> dialog will not update to show
current settings until the <a href="#time"><b>Time</b></a> value
has not changed for 1 second.
</p><p>
<a name="normalize"><b>Normalize threshold levels</b></a> adjusts the
<a href="../../ContributedSoftware/volumeviewer/volumeviewer.html#threshcolor">thresholds</a> 
(contour levels) to keep the enclosed volume constant throughout the series.
This is useful when the signal level in the data changes over time or
between states.
</p><p>
Clicking <b>Play</b> cycles through the series in the specified manner:
  <ul>
  <li><b>forward</b> - in increasing order, then back to the first (01230123...)
  <li><b>backward</b> - in decreasing order, then back to the last (32103210...)
  <li><b>oscillate</b> - alternating increasing and decreasing order 
(01232101...)
  </ul>
Clicking <b>Stop</b> halts playback.
By default, playback is as fast as possible, which can be fairly slow
for large data.  If playback is too fast, it can be slowed with the
<b>Maximum playback speed</b> option.
If playback is too slow, it may be helpful to:
<ul>
<li>reduce the size of the data by increasing its
<a href="../../ContributedSoftware/volumeviewer/volumeviewer.html#datastep">step size</a>
  and/or limiting the displayed
<a href="../../ContributedSoftware/volumeviewer/volumeviewer.html#bounds">region</a>
in <a href="../volumeviewer/framevolumeviewer.html" 
target="_top"><b>Volume Viewer</b></a>
<li>adjust caching parameters:
  <ul>
  <li><a name="datacache"><b>Data cache size (Mb) [<i>size</i>]</b></a> 
(default as specified in the
<a href="../volumeviewer/volumeviewer.html#disp-options">data display 
options</a> of
<a href="../volumeviewer/framevolumeviewer.html" 
target="_top"><b>Volume Viewer</b></a>) 
- how much memory to allot for volume data.  Increasing
the value to retain more or all of the volume data can speed playback because  
it decreases how much time is spent reading the data from disk.  
However, it is important not to increase the value to exceed or come close to
the computer's physical memory, as that will result in swapping
of data to disk and poor performance.
Clicking <b>Current use</b> shows how much of the data cache is being used
in total and by each data set.
<br><br>
  <li><b>Cache [<i>N</i>] renderings</b> - store volume rendering
(surface triangle or solid voxel) information for the <i>N</i> most recent 
displays.  This can speed playback because less time is
spent recalculating display information.  This information is
stored separately from the data cache, but the data cache is used to
store the <i>N</i> associated sets of volume data (even if that
exceeds the specified <a href="#datacache">data cache size</a>).
There is no hard limit to the memory used to cache rendering information.
Surface renderings use memory proportional to the number of triangles 
composing the surface. Solid renderings use memory proportional to the
number of data voxels displayed: about 6 bytes per grid point with 
<a href="../../ContributedSoftware/volumeviewer/volumeviewer.html#solid-options">colormapping</a>
(on by default), 20 bytes without.  For 2-byte data values, this is up to 
10 times more memory than the actual data set.  Thus, it is generally 
only feasible to cache solid display information for small data sets.
  </ul>
</ul>

<a name="markers">
<h4>MARKERS AND PATHS</h4></a>
<p>
<b>Show markers</b> enables using
<a href="../volumepathtracer/framevolpath.html" target="_top">
<b>Volume Tracer</b></a> to
<a href="../volumepathtracer/volumepathtracer.html#creating">place</a>
spherical markers on the data and to trace spatial and temporal paths.
Each marker is labeled
with the <a href="#time">time</a> of the data set on which it was placed.  
The labels are not shown.  They are used by <b>Volume Series</b> to display 
only the markers for the currently displayed <a href="#time">time</a>.  
Markers for specified numbers of earlier and 
later time points can also be shown.
</p><p>
<b>Volume Series</b> controls the display of markers in the 
<a href="../volumepathtracer/volumepathtracer.html#activeset">active set</a> 
(current set) of markers in
<a href="../volumepathtracer/framevolpath.html" target="_top">
<b>Volume Tracer</b></a>.  
Using <a href="../volumepathtracer/framevolpath.html" target="_top">
<b>Volume Tracer</b></a>,
<ul>
<li>multiple marker sets can be created
and any one chosen for display
<li>the current marker set can be
<a href="../volumepathtracer/volumepathtracer.html#filemenu">saved</a> to a 
<a href="../volumepathtracer/volumepathtracer.html#markerfiles">file</a>
for later use
</ul>
</p><p>
The <b>Color zone around markers</b> option
colors volume contour surfaces to match markers within
a specified <b>range</b>.  All of the markers associated with the 
current <a href="#time">time</a> are used to color the current surface.  
The coloring does not apply to solid displays.
</p>

<a name="notes">
<h4>NOTES</h4></a>

<p>
<b>No session support</b>.  The state of <b>Volume Series</b>
is not included in <a href="../../UsersGuide/sessions.html">session</a> files.
A saved and restored session will include the volume data sets in
<a href="../volumeviewer/framevolumeviewer.html" 
target="_top"><b>Volume Viewer</b></a>,
but the data sets will not be associated with <b>Volume Series</b>,
and there is no way to specify that they should be.
However, <a href="#markers">markers and paths</a> can be saved for later use.
</p>

<p>
<b>Slow playback when caching renderings</b>.  The second time a
surface is displayed, a graphics optimization (building an OpenGL
display list) is done to speed up future drawing of that same surface
by putting it in graphics card memory.  That optimization is time-consuming.  
The third time the surface is displayed will take
much less time if the graphics card has sufficient memory.
</p>

<p>
<b>Threshold normalization brightness glitches in solid mode</b>.
Sometimes a data set will appear dimmer than the preceding or following 
sets when solid rendering and <a href="#normalize">threshold normalization</a> 
are used.  This can happen when only two nodes are used to specify 
the transfer function on the 
<a href="../volumeviewer/volumeviewer.html#dispsolid"><b>Volume
Viewer</b> histogram</a>, with one of the nodes at the highest data value.
If a particular data set has a maximum data value much
higher than the adjacent sets, that will substantially lower the
brightness at typical data values.  This can be remedied by adding a
third node between the high and low nodes by Ctrl-clicking on the
<a href="../volumeviewer/volumeviewer.html#dispsolid"><b>Volume
Viewer</b> histogram</a>.
