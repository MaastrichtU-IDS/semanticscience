The <b>Intersurf</b> tool in Chimera
is an implementation of the method described in:

<a name="intersurf">
In this context, an <b><i>interface surface</i></b> is not the surface of
either set of atoms, but a surface that divides the space between them.</a>
The division of space is based on Delaunay tetrahedralization.
</p><p>
There are <a href="../../UsersGuide/extension.html">several ways to start</a>
<b>Intersurf</b>, a tool in the <b>Surface/Binding Analysis</b> category.
<b>Intersurf</b> is also implemented as the command
<a href="../../UsersGuide/midas/intersurf.html"><b>intersurf</b></a>.
</p><p>
The first step is to specify two sets of atoms, which can be different
<b>Molecules</b> (molecule models) or different <b>Chains</b> within the
same or different models.
(To specify sets of atoms that are not whole models or whole chains, 
it is necessary to use the command
<a href="../../UsersGuide/midas/intersurf.html"><b>intersurf</b></a> instead,
with <a href="../../UsersGuide/midas/intersurf.html#pairing">atom pairing</a>.)
Two entries should be chosen from the list of <b>Molecules</b> or 
<b>Chains</b> by clicking one and Ctrl-clicking the other, or by dragging
if the two entries are adjacent.
</p><p>
Options:
<ul>
<li><b>Solid surface (rather than mesh)</b> - whether to display the 
interface surface as solid or mesh 
<li><a name="reuse"><b>Reuse last surface (if any)</b></a> 
- whether to replace any pre-existing
interface surface with the new one (otherwise, an additional surface model
will be generated)
<li><b>Select interface atoms</b> - 
whether to <a href="../../UsersGuide/selection.html">select</a>
the atoms that <a href="#defining">define</a> the interface surface
<li><b>Residue centroid distance pruning</b> - whether to ignore
residues whose centroids are not within the <b>Prune distance</b> 
(default <b>30.0</b> &Aring;) of any residue centroid in the other set of atoms 
</ul>
The <b>Molecule bias</b> determines how the space between the two
sets of atoms should be divided.
<a name="defining">
Each vertex in the interface surface lies between two atoms,
one from each set.</a>
The <b>Molecule bias</b> ranges from 0 to 1, where a bias of <b>0.5</b> 
(default) places each interface surface point equidistant from the 
<a href="../../UsersGuide/midas/vdwrad.html">VDW surfaces</a>
of the two corresponding atoms. 
A bias of 0.0 places interface surface vertices at the VDW surface
of the set higher in the list of <b>Molecules</b> or <b>Chains</b> 
(regardless of order chosen), and a bias of 1.0 places them at
the VDW surface of the set lower in the list.
Where the VDW surfaces of the two sets coincide, changes in bias will
have little effect on interface surface vertex placement.
</p><p>
<b>OK</b> generates the interface surface and dismisses the dialog, 
whereas <b>Apply</b> generates the surface without dismissing the dialog.
<b>Close</b> dismisses the <b>Intersurf</b> dialog, and
<b>Help</b> opens this manual page in a browser window. 
</p><p>
An interface surface is a separate model that can be:
<ul>
<li> hidden/shown with
the <a href="../../UsersGuide/modelpanel.html"><b>Model Panel</b></a>
or the command
<a href="../../UsersGuide/midas/modeldisplay.html"><b>modeldisplay</b></a>
<li> closed (deleted) with
the <a href="../../UsersGuide/modelpanel.html"><b>Model Panel</b></a>
or the command
<a href="../../UsersGuide/midas/open.html"><b>close</b></a>
</ul>
When an interface surface is generated, the histogram is populated 
with the corresponding atom-atom distances.
The calculation can be repeated 
to adjust the <a href="#coloring">coloring</a> (preferably with the
<a href="#reuse"><b>Reuse last surface</b></a> option turned on).
</p>

<a name="coloring">
<h3>Coloring</h3></a>
<p>
The histogram with sliders (<i><b>thresholds</i></b>) allows the surface 
to be colored by the distance between atoms across the interface.
Interface surfaces can also be colored according to volume data
(with <a href="../surfcolor/surfcolor.html"><b>Surface Color</b></a>)
and to match atoms
(with <a href="../colorzone/colorzone.html"><b>Color Zone</b></a>).
</p><p>
Clicking on a threshold shows its distance <b>Value</b> in black.
Clicking elsewhere within the histogram shows the <b>Value</b>
(X-coordinate) of the mouseclick in gray.
A threshold can be moved by changing its <b>Value</b>
and then pressing Enter (return) or by dragging it horizontally
with the left mouse button.  Holding the Shift
key down reduces the speed (mouse sensitivity) of threshold
dragging tenfold, allowing finer control.
Thresholds can be added by Ctrl-clicking
with the left mouse button on the histogram.  
Ctrl-clicking on an existing threshold deletes it.
Besides a <b>Value</b> (position on the histogram), 
each threshold has a <b>Color</b>.
The <b>Color</b> applies to the threshold most recently moved or clicked
and can be adjusted by clicking the adjacent
<a href="../../UsersGuide/coloring.html#colorwell">color well</a>.
</p><p>
The thresholds define a function that maps distances to colors.
For each surface point, the corresponding atom-atom distance
is compared to the thresholds on the histogram.
Color is defined by red, green, blue and opacity/transparency components.
The color of the closest threshold at a lower value (to the left) and 
the color of the closest threshold at a higher value (to the right) 
are linearly interpolated.
Points with distance values less than the leftmost threshold are colored
according to the leftmost threshold, while 
points with distance values greater than the rightmost threshold are colored
according to the rightmost threshold.
