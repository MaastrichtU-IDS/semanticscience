<h3>Minrms Plot
<img src="mpicon.png" alt="icon"></h3>
<p>
<b>Minrms Plot</b> displays results from the separate program
<a href="http://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/Research/minrms/index.html" 
target="_blank"><b>MinRMS</b></a>,
which generates a series of structural alignments (superpositions)
of two protein structures.  
<b>MinRMS</b> is a stand-alone, nongraphical program
that is run from the system command line, not from within Chimera.
It is not included with Chimera, but is
<a href="http://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/Research/minrms/index.html" target="_blank">
available</a> for download in source code form.
</p><p>

Briefly, <b>MinRMS</b>
creates many superpositions of the same two structures
differing in the number of residues paired;
for a given number of pairings, the superposition is that which minimizes the
RMSD.  The <i>n</i>th entry of the "lowest-RMSD list" consists of a structural
alignment and the <i>n</i> residue pairings within it used to calculate
the RMSD.  Each list item can be expressed as a sequence alignment in
MSF format (file <b>align<i>n</i>.msf</b>);
the corresponding rotation/translation information is included in the comments.
The <i>n</i> residue pairings are aligned in sequence within the MSF file.  
</p><p>
<b>Minrms Plot</b> graphs the numerical results,
shows the structural alignments, and calls
<a href="../multalignviewer/framemav.html" target="_top"><b>Multalign
Viewer</b></a> to show the corresponding sequence alignments.
</p><p>
There are <a href="../../UsersGuide/extension.html">several ways to start</a>
<b>Minrms Plot</b>, a tool in the <b>Structure Comparison</b> category.
Starting <b>Minrms Plot</b> brings up a dialog box requesting the
file <b>align_chimera.info</b> previously created by <b>MinRMS</b>.
This file lists <i>pdb1</i> and <i>pdb2</i> (the names of the
two PDB files), the name of the plot data file
(currently just <b>align_chimera.plot</b>),
and the number of alignment files to be read.
</p><p>
<img src="mprmsd.png" alt="RMSD vs. N graph" align="left">
Upon reading the file, Chimera will display the molecules in
<i>pdb1</i> and <i>pdb2</i> in the graphics window and open
an additional <b>Minrms Plot</b> window containing a graph.
Initially, the molecules are not superimposed (and may not both be
visible); their positions depend on the coordinates in the input PDB files.
Showing just the backbone or chain trace of proteins
is recommended to simplify the display.
</p><p>
The <b>RMSD vs. N graph</b>
depicts the members of the "lowest-RMSD list" of structural alignments
that have been written out as MSF files.
RMSD is shown in green, the longest distance between paired residues
in blue, and an adaptation of the
<a href="#probscore">Levitt-Gerstein probability score</a>
in red versus increasing number of residue pairings, or "matches."
The -log(probability) is shown, where probability represents the
likelihood that such a favorable superposition could be attained by chance
(proteins not structurally related);
larger values of -log(probability) indicate greater significance.
<b>Clicking with the mouse within this graph determines
which structural alignment is displayed in the graphics window</b>.
In the figure, the graph has been clicked to choose the alignment
with 211 residue pairs (matches).
<b>Zoom In</b> expands the graph to show a smaller range of N in
the same area; <b>Zoom Out</b> reverses this.  
</p><p>
<b>Show Alignment</b> indicates that the sequence alignment 
corresponding to the current structural alignment should be shown in
<a href="../multalignviewer/framemav.html" 
target="_top"><b>Multalign Viewer</b></a>.
When the structural alignment is changed by clicking on the graph,
<a href="../multalignviewer/framemav.html" 
target="_top"><b>Multalign Viewer</b></a>
will automatically switch to the corresponding sequence alignment.
</p><p>
<b>Hide</b> dismisses the interface without exiting from <b>Minrms Plot</b>.
When the <b>Minrms Plot</b> interface is hidden or obscured by other windows, 
it can be resurrected using the <b>Raise</b> option for the <b>Minrms Plot</b>
<a href="../../UsersGuide/instances.html">instance in the
<b>Tools</b> menu</a>.  <b>Close</b> closes
the <b>Minrms Plot</b> window, and <b>Help</b> opens this manual
page in a browser window.
</p><p>
The structure in <i>pdb1</i> is static (unless moved interactively
by the user) and the structure in <i>pdb2</i> is reoriented relative to
the first.  Residue pairings are indicated with green
<a href="../../UsersGuide/pbpanel.html#pbdef">pseudobonds</a>
in the graphics window.
