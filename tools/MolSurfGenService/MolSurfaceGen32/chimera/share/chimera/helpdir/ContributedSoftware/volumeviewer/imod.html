<title>IMOD Segmentation Files</title>
</head><body>
<h2>IMOD Segmentation Files</h2>
<p>
<a href="http://bio3d.colorado.edu/imod/" target="_blank">IMOD</a> 
is a suite of programs for processing and analyzing data 
from electron microscopy and tomography.  
<a href="http://bio3d.colorado.edu/imod/doc/binspec.html"
target="_blank">IMOD binary files</a>
contain segmentation mesh data and contour data.
They can be opened in many ways, like other 
<a href="../../UsersGuide/filetypes.html">registered file types</a>.  
The IMOD file type can be indicated with a suffix 
(<b>.imod</b> or <b>.mod</b>, part of the filename)
or a prefix (<b>imod:</b>, not part of the filename).  
</p><p>
By default, only the <b><i>mesh data</i></b> are read and displayed.
The <b><i>contour data</i></b> are not read by default
because creating contours is slow, but reading such data can be
enabled as described <a href="#enable">below</a>.
Mesh data are displayed as models of the same type as created by
<a href="framevolumeviewer.html" target="_top"><b>Volume Viewer</b></a>.
The mesh for each object in the IMOD file becomes a separate 
<a href="../../UsersGuide/surfattrib.html#surfpiecedef">surface piece</a> 
in a single
<a href="../../UsersGuide/surfattrib.html#surfmodels">surface model</a>
and is colored as indicated in the IMOD file.
IMOD surfaces are not saved in 
<a href="../../UsersGuide/sessions.html">sessions</a>.
</p><p>
By default, hovering the mouse cursor over a segmented object (without
clicking any buttons) will show the name of the  object.
This <b>atomspec balloon</b> behavior can be turned off in the
<a href="../../UsersGuide/preferences.html#General"><b>General</b> preferences</a>.

<h3>Contour Data</h3></a>
<p>
To enable reading contour data, it is necessary to modify the code:
in the file <b>share/IMOD/ChimeraExtension.py</b>,
change "contours = False" to "contours = True" and restart Chimera.
IMOD contour lines and points will then be read and shown as
<a href="../volumepathtracer/framevolpath.html"
target="_top"><b>Volume Tracer</b></a> markers and links.
A separate marker set will be generated for each IMOD object
that has contours.
