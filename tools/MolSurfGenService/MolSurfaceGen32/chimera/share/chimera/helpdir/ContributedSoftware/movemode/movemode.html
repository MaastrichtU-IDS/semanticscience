<h3>Movement Mouse Mode
<img src="movemodeicon.png" alt="Movement Mouse Mode icon"></h3>
<p>
<b>Movement Mouse Mode</b> enables moving part or all of a molecule model
(and not other parts or other models) with the mouse regardless of
<a href="../../UsersGuide/mouse.html#activedef">activation status</a>.  
The set of atoms to move can be a
<a href="../../UsersGuide/selection.html">selection</a>,
chain, secondary structure element, or whole molecule model.
This tool allows making coarse modifications to structures, after which
their coordinates can be <a href="../../UsersGuide/savemodel.html">saved</a>.
</p><p>
There are <a href="../../UsersGuide/extension.html">several ways to start</a>
<b>Movement Mouse Mode</b>, a tool in the <b>Structure Editing</b> and
<b>Movement</b> categories.
</p><p>
The dialog controls which items will rotate and translate in response to
<a href="../../UsersGuide/mouse.html">mouse manipulations</a>:
<ul>
<li><b>Normal</b> (default)
- all models that are
<a href="../../UsersGuide/mouse.html#activedef">activated for motion</a>
<li><b>Move selection</b>
- the currently <a href="../../UsersGuide/selection.html">selected</a> atoms 
and/or <a href="../../UsersGuide/surfattrib.html#surfpiecedef">surface 
pieces</a>;
when nothing is <a href="../../UsersGuide/selection.html">selected</a>,
as <b>Normal</b> 
<li><b>Move molecule</b>
- the molecule model under the cursor when the mouse button was pressed;
when no molecule model was under the cursor, as <b>Normal</b>
<li><b>Move chain</b>
- the chain under the cursor when the mouse button was pressed;
when no chain was under the cursor, as <b>Normal</b>
<li><b>Move helix, strand, or turn</b>
- the helix, strand, or other peptide chain segment 
(comprised of residues containing CA)
under the cursor when the mouse button was pressed; 
when no such segment was under the cursor, as <b>Normal</b>
</ul>
The buttons assigned to rotation, XY-translation, and Z-translation 
(as shown in the
<a href="../../UsersGuide/preferences.html#Mouse"><b>Mouse</b> preferences</a>)
are not changed, only what they control.
</p><p>
<b><i>Nonstandard</i></b> movements (by mouse modes other than <b>Normal</b>)
occur regardless of model
<a href="../../UsersGuide/mouse.html#activedef">activation</a> status.
There is no consideration of what is physically reasonable;
any bonds between movable and immovable parts will simply stretch and distort.
Nonstandard movements can be undone and redone by clicking 
the <b>Undo Move</b> and <b>Redo Move</b> buttons, respectively.  
A history of up to 100 nonstandard movements is stored.  
Positions are only logged after pauses in motion of at least 1 second.
(The separate <a href="../undomove/undomove.html"><b>Undo/Redo Move</b></a>
tool handles only standard movements.)
</p><p>
The center of rotation is as described in the
<a href="../../UsersGuide/sideview.html#rotation"><b>Rotation</b></a>
tool, except that only the movable atoms are considered when calculating
the bounding box for the <b>center of models</b> method.
