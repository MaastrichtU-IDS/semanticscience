<b>Per-Model Clipping</b> allows different models to be clipped
in different ways.  Unlike the
<a href="../../UsersGuide/clipping.html#global">global clipping planes</a>,
a per-model clipping plane:
<ul>
<li>affects only one model
<li>can be placed at any angle relative to the line of sight
</ul>
Except in <a href="#slab">slab mode</a>,
a per-model clipping plane is a single plane that separates the
visible and invisible portions of a model; whether it behaves like a
"front" or "back" depends on the direction it is facing.
In <a href="#slab">slab mode</a>, a per-model clipping plane
behaves like a front-back pair of planes locked in parallel. 
</p><p>
Each model can have one per-model clipping plane.
A molecule model and its associated 
<a href="../../UsersGuide/representation.html#surfaces">molecular surface</a>
are treated as separate models.
Per-model clipping planes and slabs are saved in
<a href="../../UsersGuide/sessions.html#sesdef">sessions</a>.
</p><p>
There are <a href="../../UsersGuide/extension.html">several ways to start</a>
<b>Per-Model Clipping</b>, a tool in the <b>Depiction</b> category.
Per-model clipping can also be controlled with the command 
<a href="../../UsersGuide/midas/mclip.html"><b>mclip</b></a>.
<blockquote>
The <b>Model</b> pulldown menu shows the 
<a name="currmod"><b><i>current model</i></b></a>
and allows switching between models.
</blockquote><blockquote>
Activating <a name="enable"><b>Enable clipping</b></a>
turns on a clipping plane for the <a href="#currmod">current model</a>.
The plane's starting position is perpendicular to the line of sight 
with its center of rotation at the current center of view; 
the visible portion of the model is behind the plane.
</blockquote><blockquote>
Activating
<a name="slab"><b>Use slab mode with thickness [<i>d</i>]</b></a>
(with <i>d</i> &gt; 0) limits the visible portion of the 
<a href="#currmod">current model</a> to a slab <i>d</i> units thick;
<i>d</i> = <b>5.0</b> by default.  
The units depend on the data but are usually angstroms.
</blockquote>
The clipping plane can be moved <a href="#mouse">with the mouse</a>
and/or by using:
<ul>
<li><b>Orient plane</b> - place the plane perpendicular to the line 
of sight with its center of rotation at the current center of 
view, with the visible portion of the model behind the plane
<li><b>Flip plane</b> - flip the plane so that the previously visible
portion of the model is invisible and vice versa
<li><b>Align plane</b> - align the clipping plane with that of another model
(chosen from the pulldown menu); 
both planes must be <a href="#enable">enabled</a>
</ul>
<b>Cap clipped surfaces...</b> brings up the
<a href="../surfcapper/surfcapper.html"><b>Surface
Capping</b></a> dialog for controlling the appearance of planar
caps where surfaces are sliced away.
</p><p>
<b>Close</b> closes the <b>Per-Model Clipping</b> interface and
turns off mouse control of all per-model clipping planes.
Any per-model planes that have been enabled, however, will remain enabled
until explicitly disabled (by unchecking <b>Enable clipping</b>).
<b>Help</b> opens this manual page in a browser window.

<h3><a name="mouse">Mouse Modes</a> <img src="pmcmodes.png"></h3>
<p>
Activating <b>Adjust clipping with mouse as below</b> allows the clipping
plane to be moved independently with the mouse.
The <b>Clip Motion Assignments</b> determine which buttons are used.
<b>Translation</b> moves the plane along its normal without changing the
angle; the direction of translation caused by a particular cursor motion
depends on the angle of the plane.
<b>Rotation</b> changes the angle of the plane,
with cursor control similar to that of standard rotation.
During such manipulations, the plane's position
is illustrated with a semitransparent disk.
The plane-controlling mouse modes are shown in the
<a href="../../UsersGuide/preferences.html#Mouse"><b>Mouse</b>
preferences</a> after <b>Per-Model Clipping</b> has been started.
</p><p>
Changing the <a href="#currmod">current model</a> turns off
mouse control of the previous model's clipping plane.  When mouse
control is turned off for all per-model clipping planes,
the mouse buttons return to their previous functions (as shown in the
<a href="../../UsersGuide/preferences.html#Mouse">
<b>Mouse</b> preferences</a>).  During standard rotation and translation
operations, each per-model clipping plane will move along with its associated
model.  If a model is not
<a href="../../UsersGuide/mouse.html#activedef">active</a>,
neither it nor its clipping plane will move.
