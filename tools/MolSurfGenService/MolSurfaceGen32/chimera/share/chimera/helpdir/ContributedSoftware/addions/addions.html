<p>
<b>Add Ions</b> adds monatomic counterions around molecule models using
<a href="http://ambermd.org/#AmberTools" target="_blank">AmberTools</a>.
Thanks to Wei Zhang (The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston)
for implementing this tool.  See also:
<a href="../solvate/solvate.html"><b>Solvate</b></a>,
<a href="writeprmtop.html"><b>Write Prmtop</b></a>
</p><p>
There are <a href="../../UsersGuide/extension.html">several ways to start</a>
<b>Add Ions</b>, a tool in the <b>Structure Editing</b>  and <b>Amber</b> 
categories.
</p><p>
The model of interest should be chosen from the list.
Multiple models can be chosen, but they will be considered 
individually rather than as a combined system.
</p><p>
The ions will be placed in electrostatically favorable locations 
according to a Coulombic potential on a grid.
The molecule model must already include hydrogens and charge assignments;
otherwise, dialogs will appear for running 
<a href="../addh/addh.html"><b>AddH</b></a> and
<a href="../addcharge/addcharge.html"><b>Add Charge</b></a>
as needed prior to adding ions.  The potential grid is calculated using
a distance-dependent dielectric and ignoring any solvent molecules.
A solvent molecule found to overlap with an ion will be removed.
</p><p>
<b>Ion types</b>:
<ul>
<li><b>Br-</b>
<li><b>Cl-</b>
<li><b>Cs+</b>
<li><b>F-</b>
<li><b>I-</b>
<li><b>K+</b>
<li><b>Li+</b>
<li><b>Mg++</b>
<li><b>Na+</b>
<li><b>Rb+</b>
</ul>
The number of ions can be set to <b>neutralize</b> the molecule 
(in which case the ion type and molecule must have charges of opposite signs)
or to a <b>specific number</b>.
</p><p>
<b>OK</b> initiates adding ions and dismisses the panel,
while <b>Apply</b> adds ions without dismissing the panel.
Addition may take several seconds; progress is reported in the
<a href="../../UsersGuide/chimerawindow.html#statusline">status line</a>.
<b>Close</b> dismisses the panel without adding any ions.
<b>Help</b> brings up this manual page in a browser window.
