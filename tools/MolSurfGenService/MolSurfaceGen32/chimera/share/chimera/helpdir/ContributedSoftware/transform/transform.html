<h3>Transform Molecule Coordinates
<img src="transformicon.png" alt="Transform Molecule Coordinates icon"></h3>
<p>
<b>Transform Molecule Coordinates</b> applies a rotation and translation 
to a molecule model or 
<a href="../volumepathtracer/framevolpath.html" target="_top">marker set</a>.
</p><p>
There are <a href="../../UsersGuide/extension.html">several ways to start</a>
<b>Transform Molecule Coordinates</b>, a tool in the <b>Movement</b> category.
</p><p>
The <b>Molecule</b> should be chosen from the list of open molecule models.
Its transformation is specified with:
<ul>
<li><b>Euler angles [&phi; &theta; &psi;]</b> - rotations 
defined by the <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/EulerAngles.html"
target="_blank">&chi;-convention</a>,
where the first rotation is by an angle &phi; about the Z-axis,
the second is by an angle &theta; (potentially ranging from 0 to &pi;)
about the new X-axis, and the third is by an angle &psi; 
about the new Z-axis.
<br><br>
<li><b>Shift [<i>X Y Z</i>]</b> - translations along X, Y, and Z
</ul>
Clicking <b>Apply</b> changes the atomic coordinates of the model 
(not its transformation matrix).
The cumulative change from the original coordinates is reported in the dialog.
<b>Reset</b> restores the original coordinates.
<b>Set</b> is equivalent to clicking <b>Reset</b> and then <b>Apply</b>.
</p><p>
Note the original coordinates and cumulative change information
will not be retained in a saved 
<a href="../../UsersGuide/sessions.html#sesdef">session</a>.
