<b>Tile Structures</b> "tiles" models:
it separates and spaces them evenly in the viewing plane.  
This is one way to show a set of related structures, such as
snapshots from a simulation.  See also: 
<a href="../ensemblematch/ensemblematch.html"><b>Ensemble Match</b></a>,
<a href="../ensemblecluster/ensemblecluster.html"><b>Ensemble Cluster</b></a>
</p><p>
There are <a href="../../UsersGuide/extension.html">several ways to start</a>
<b>Tile Structures</b>, a tool in the <b>Structure Comparison</b> and
<b>MD/Ensemble Analysis</b> categories.
It is also implemented as the command
<a href="../../UsersGuide/midas/tile.html"><b>tile</b></a>,
which has more options than the graphical interface.
</p><p>
Starting <b>Tile Structures</b> opens a dialog for specifying
which models should be tiled. 
Individual models or blocks of models 
can be chosen from the <b>Models</b> list with the left mouse button. 
Chosen lines are highlighted in the dialog.
<b>Ctrl</b>-click toggles the status of a line, while clicking on the first 
(or last) line of a contiguous block and then <b>Shift</b>-clicking 
on the last (or first) chooses all of the lines in the block.
</p><p>
<b>Border scale</b> indicates how far apart the structures should be spaced, 
with larger values giving greater separations.
The default of <b>1.0</b> spaces the models so that their bounding
spheres abut, while 0.0 superimposes the bounding sphere centers.
</p><p>
<b>OK</b> tiles the structures and dismisses the dialog,
while <b>Apply</b> tiles the structures without dismissing the dialog.
<b>Close</b> dismisses the dialog without performing any tiling.
<b>Help</b> brings up this manual page in a browser window.
</p><p>
The command <A href="../../UsersGuide/midas/set.html#independent"><b>set 
independent</b></A> can be used to make models rotate about
individual centers rather than a collective center.
</p><p>
Default or previously saved positions can be restored with the
command <a href="../../UsersGuide/midas/reset.html"><b>reset</b></a>,
while previous model transformations (but not scale or camera center)
can be restored with <a href="../undomove/undomove.html"><b>Undo Move</b></a>.
