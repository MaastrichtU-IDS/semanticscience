<h3>Secondary Structure Predictions with GOR</h3>
<p>
The <a href="framemav.html" target="_top"><b>Multalign Viewer</b></a> 
menu setting <b>Structure... Secondary Structure... show predicted</b> shows
<a href="multalignviewer.html#regions">regions</a> named 
<b>predicted helices</b> (gold outline)
and <b>predicted strands</b> (green outline)
in sequences not associated with structures.
</p><p>
These predictions are generated
for individual sequences using the method described in:
<blockquote>
<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/642007" target="_blank">
Analysis of the accuracy and implications of simple methods for predicting 
the secondary structure of globular proteins.</a>
Garnier J, Osguthorpe DJ, Robson B.
<i>J Mol Biol.</i> 1978 Mar 25;120(1):97-120.
</blockquote>
This method, generally referred to as <b>GOR</b> (based on authors'
last initials), is used with the newer single-residue parameters given in:
<blockquote>
<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3430614" target="_blank">
Further developments of protein secondary structure prediction using 
information theory. New parameters and consideration of residue pairs.</a>
Gibrat JF, Garnier J, Robson B.
<i>J Mol Biol.</i> 1987 Dec 5;198(3):425-43.
</blockquote>
The residue-pair parameters introduced in the latter paper are not used.
The single-residue approximation alone yielded 56% accuracy, whereas
addition of the residue-pair parameters increased the accuracy to 63%.
