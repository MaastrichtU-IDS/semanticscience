<h3>Ensemble Match
<img src="ensemblematch.png" alt="Ensemble Match icon"></h3>
<p>
An <b><i>ensemble</i></b> contains multiple sets of coordinates for
exactly the same atoms, for example, snapshots along a simulation
trajectory or different solutions of NMR data.
</p><p>
<b>Ensemble Match</b> calculates superpositions and RMSD values 
for every pairwise comparison between two ensembles.
Each ensemble must contain at least one structure (ensemble member), 
and the members of the two ensembles must contain the same set of atoms.
<b>Ensemble Match</b> can also be used to compare
an ensemble to itself.  However, if the ensemble has many members,
<a href="../movie/framemovie.html" target="_top"><b>MD Movie</b></a>
may be more appropriate for obtaining all-by-all pairwise RMSD values
(see <a href="../movie/movie.html#rmsd">RMSD analysis</a>).

<a href="../ensemblecluster/ensemblecluster.html"><b>Ensemble Cluster</b></a>,
<a href="../ensembletile/ensembletile.html"><b>Tile Structures</b></a>,
<a href="../../UsersGuide/superposition.html">superimposing structures</a>
</p><p>
First, each ensemble should be opened in Chimera from a single PDB file
(with <tt>MODEL</tt> and <tt>ENDMDL</tt> records delimiting individual
members, if more than one).
There are <a href="../../UsersGuide/extension.html">several ways to start</a>
<b>Ensemble Match</b>, a tool in the <b>Structure Comparison</b> and
<b>MD/Ensemble Analysis</b> categories.
</p><p>
One ensemble should be designated as the <b>Reference</b> and the
other as the <b>Alternative</b>.  In the resulting table of comparisons, 
the reference structures will be listed vertically
(the alternatives horizontally)
and any matching operations will move the alternative structure onto the 
reference.  <b>Parts to Match</b> are indicated with a command-line
<a href="../../UsersGuide/midas/atom_spec.html#basic">atom specification</a>;
if this field is left blank, all atoms will be used.
The <a href="../../UsersGuide/midas/atom_spec.html#basic">
atom specification</a> describes the atoms to be used in <i>each</i>
structure.
If atom names are given, they should specify equal numbers of atoms
occurring in the same order in the different structures (if <b>@ca</b>
is entered, the first CA in a structure is matched with the first CA in
other structures, the second CA with the second in other structures,
<i>etc.</i>). 
</p><p>
<b>OK</b> performs the calculation and dismisses the dialog,
while <b>Apply</b> performs the calculation without dismissing the dialog.
<b>Close</b> dismisses the dialog without performing any calculation.
<b>Help</b> brings up this manual page in a browser window.
</p><p>
The resulting RMSD values are shown in a table.
If the table is hidden (by clicking the <b>Hide</b> button) or
becomes obscured by other windows, it
can be resurrected using the <b>Raise</b> option for its
<a href="../../UsersGuide/instances.html">instance in the
<b>Tools</b> menu</a>.  <b>Quit</b> closes the table
and exits from <b>Ensemble Match</b>.
</p>

The figure at right
shows comparisons between a reference ensemble with three members
(models 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3) and an alternative ensemble with three members 
(models 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3).
</p><p>
Checking the box next to an RMSD value performs the corresponding 
pairwise superposition.
The number of atom pairs used to calculate the RMSD is reported in the
<a href="../../UsersGuide/chimerawindow.html#statusline">status line</a>
(the atoms to use were specified previously as the <b>Parts to Match</b>).
More than one alternative structure may be
matched to the same reference structure, but a particular alternative
structure cannot be matched to more than one reference structure at a time.  
It may be helpful to first use
<a href="../ensembletile/ensembletile.html"><b>Tile Structures</b></a> 
to spread out the members of the reference ensemble and 
facilitate inspection of the matches.
</p><p>
Clicking an "A" box
<a href="../../UsersGuide/mouse.html#activedef">
activates/deactivates</a> a model for motion.
A deactivated model will not move in response to 
<a href="../../UsersGuide/mouse.html">mouse manipulations</a> in
the main window or movement commands such as
<a href="../../UsersGuide/midas/move.html"><b>move</b></a> and
<a href="../../UsersGuide/midas/turn.html"><b>turn</b></a>.
Clicking a "D" box hides/shows a model 
(enables or disables display at the model level, see
<a href="../../UsersGuide/hierarchy.html#displevels">display hierarchy</a>).
Clicking an "x" button both deactivates and undisplays
the corresponding alternative model.
Clicking a "globe" button activates the corresponding
reference model and all alternative models currently matched
to it while deactivating all other models.  The "stick man"
button does all the things the "globe" button does, <i>plus</i>
zooms in on the corresponding reference model.
