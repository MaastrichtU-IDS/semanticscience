<h3>Clustal Conservation Groups</h3>
<p>
The clustal format read and written by
<a href="framemav.html" target="_top"><b>Multalign Viewer</b></a>
includes characters symbolizing degree of conservation.
</p><p>
Positions where every residue is the same type (complete identity)
are marked with an asterisk (*).
</p><p>
Positions where one of the following <b>strong</b> groups is fully conserved are
marked with a colon (:).
<blockquote><pre>
STA  
NEQK  
NHQK  
NDEQ  
QHRK  
MILV  
MILF  
HY  
FYW

Positions where one of the following <b>weak</b> groups is fully conserved are
marked with a period (.).
<blockquote><pre>
CSA  
ATV  
SAG  
STNK  
STPA  
SGND  
SNDEQK  
NDEQHK  
NEQHRK

The groups are defined using the PAM250 matrix; scores within the strong
groups are over 0.5 and scores within the weak groups are positive but
no greater than 0.5.
