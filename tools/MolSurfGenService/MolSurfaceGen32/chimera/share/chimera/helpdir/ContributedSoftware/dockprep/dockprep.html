<h3>Dock Prep <img src="prepicon.png" alt="Dock Prep icon"></h3>
<p>
<b>Dock Prep</b> performs several tasks to prepare structures for
<a href="http://dock.compbio.ucsf.edu/index.html" target="_blank">DOCK</a>
or for other calculations, such as:
<ul>
<li> deleting water molecules
<li> repairing truncated sidechains
<li> adding hydrogens
<li> assigning partial charges
<li> writing files in Mol2 format
</ul>
Many of these steps can be performed separately in Chimera, but
<b>Dock Prep</b> unites them for convenience.  Thanks to P. Therese Lang 
(DOCK development team, see <a href="#references">references</a>) 
for helping to develop this tool.

If extra molecules such as ligands or additional subunits are present but
unwanted during docking, these should be 
<a href="../editing/editing.html#deletion">deleted</a> 
before <b>Dock Prep</b> is used.  
<b>Dock Prep</b> does not delete such molecules (other than water
and certain ions, optionally) because they could be important 
for binding or for maintaining receptor structure.
Conversely, the biologically relevant form of the receptor
may contain more subunits than are present in the structure file.  
If important for downstream calculations, the relevant form
should be generated before <b>Dock Prep</b> is run.
For obtaining multimers, see:
<a href="../../UsersGuide/fetch.html">fetching</a> PQS files,
the command <a href="../../UsersGuide/midas/sym.html#secondary"><b>sym</b></a>,
<a href="../multiscale/framemulti.html" target="_top"><b>Multiscale
Models</b></a>, <a href="../unitcell/unitcell.html"><b>Unit Cell</b></a>
</p><p>
There are <a href="../../UsersGuide/extension.html">several ways to start</a>
<b>Dock Prep</b>, a tool in the <b>Structure Editing</b> category
(including using it via
<a href="../minimize/minimize.html"><b>Minimize Structure</b></a>).
</p><p>
<a name="chosen">
Under <b>Molecules to prep</b>, the structure(s) of interest 
should be chosen from the list of open molecule models.
</a>
Individual models or blocks of models can be chosen with the left mouse
button.  Ctrl-click toggles the status of an individual model.
To choose a block of models without dragging,
click on the first (or last) and then Shift-click 
on the last (or first) in the desired block.
</p><p>
<a name="tasks">
Several operations can be performed on the chosen structures:
</a>
<ul>
<li> <b>Delete solvent</b> - delete any
<a href="../../UsersGuide/midas/surface.html#surfcats">solvent</a> 
molecules (usually waters).  This is generally done to prepare
a receptor structure for docking.
If any solvent molecules are thought to be important for ligand
binding, however, one should manually delete the <i>other</i> solvent 
residues beforehand and deactivate this option in <b>Dock Prep</b>.
<br><br>
<li> <b>Delete non-complexed ions</b> - delete any
<a href="../../UsersGuide/midas/surface.html#surfcats">ions</a> 
that are not participating in covalent or coordination bonds
(by default, the latter are shown as dashed lines).
This bonded-or-not distinction is based solely on input bond specifications
such as CONECT and LINK records in PDB files; it is not inferred from
the chemistry of the system.
<br><br>
<li> <b>If alternate locations, keep only highest occupancy</b> - 
for atoms with alternate locations, retain only the highest-occupancy set
(if a tie, the set with a lower B-factor where the alternate locations
branch from the common structure)
</ul>
<blockquote>
<b>Change</b> - convert modified residues to standard residues for which
parameters are available:
<ul>
<li> <b>selenomethionine (MSE) to methionine (MET)</b> - change
<a href="http://ligand-expo.rcsb.org/pyapps/ldHandler.py?formid=cc-index-search&target=MSE&operation=ccid" target="_blank">MSE</a>
residues to MET by changing the selenium atom to a sulfur atom named SD
and adjusting the CG-SD and SD-CE bond lengths to 1.81 and 1.78 &Aring;,
respectively
<li> <b>bromo-UMP (5BU) to UMP (U)</b> - 
change 5-bromouridine-5'-monophosphate (PDB chemical component 
<a href="http://ligand-expo.rcsb.org/pyapps/ldHandler.py?formid=cc-index-search&target=5BU&operation=ccid" target="_blank">5BU</a>)
to RNA residue uridine-5'-monophosphate (U)
by deleting the bromine atom
<li> <b>methylselenyl-dUMP (UMS) to UMP (U)</b> - 
change 2'-methylselenyl-2'-deoxyuridine-5'-phosphate (PDB chemical component
<a href="http://ligand-expo.rcsb.org/pyapps/ldHandler.py?formid=cc-index-search&target=UMS&operation=ccid" target="_blank">UMS</a>)
to RNA residue uridine-5'-monophosphate (U)
by replacing the methylselenyl moiety with an oxygen atom named O2'
and adjusting the bond length to 1.430 &Aring;
<li> <b>methylselenyl-dCMP (CSL) to CMP (C)</b> - 
change 2'-methylselenyl-2'-deoxycytidine-5'-phosphate (PDB chemical component
<a href="http://ligand-expo.rcsb.org/pyapps/ldHandler.py?formid=cc-index-search&target=CSL&operation=ccid" target="_blank">CSL</a>)
to RNA residue cytidine-5'-monophosphate (C)
by replacing the methylselenyl moiety with an oxygen atom named O2'
and adjusting the bond length to 1.430 &Aring;
</ul>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li> <a name="truncated"><b>Incomplete side chains:</b></a>
<br><br>
  <ul>
  <li><a name="replace"><b>Replace using Dunbrack rotamer library</b></a>
  <li><b>Replace using Richardson (common-atom) rotamer library</b>
  <li><b>Replace using Richardson (mode) rotamer library</b>
  <li><a name="mutate"><b>Mutate residues to ALA (if CB present) or GLY</b></a>
<p>
The <a href="#replace">rotamer library options</a>
replace each truncated sidechain with a complete sidechain of the same
residue type, as if using the command 
<a href="../../UsersGuide/midas/swapaa.html"><b>swapaa</b></a>
with the specified <a href="../../UsersGuide/midas/swapaa.html#lib">rotamer
library</a> and <b>preserve true</b> (default settings of other
<a href="../../UsersGuide/midas/swapaa.html#options">options</a>).
If different settings are desired, use
<a href="../../UsersGuide/midas/swapaa.html"><b>swapaa</b></a> separately
before using <b>Dock Prep</b>.
The <a href="#mutate">mutation option</a> changes each residue with a 
truncated sidechain to glycine or alanine, the latter if a CB atom is present.
</p><p>
Using one of these options to generate complete sidechains is recommended 
because in incomplete residues, the partial charges will not sum to integer 
values, and extra hydrogens (unrecognized in the charge addition step) 
will be added where the missing atoms would have been attached.
</p>
  </ul>
<li> <b>Add hydrogens</b> - call
<a href="../addh/addh.html"><b>AddH</b></a> for hydrogen addition.
This tool aims to generate protonation states reasonable at physiological pH. 
For example, hydrogens are not added to the phosphodiester moieties
of DNA and RNA.	By default, aspartic acid and glutamic acid sidechains
are assumed to be negatively charged,
while arginine and lysine sidechains are assumed to be positively charged
(although <a href="../addcharge/addcharge.html#alterstates">other states
can be attained</a>).
Ambiguous groups are terminal phosphates
(the third ionization) and imidazoles such as histidine sidechains.
Histidine protonation states can be
<a href="../addh/addh.html#hisprot">user-specified</a> or guessed by the
<a href="../addh/addh.html#method">method</a>.  Whether a terminal phosphate
is triply ionized is  guessed using bond lengths.
<a href="../addh/addh.html#termini">Additional rules</a>
 are used to identify and handle chain termini.
<p>
Potentially ambiguous or rare (shifted-pKa) protonation states,
especially in binding sites and nonstandard residues,
should be verified and corrected before charges are assigned.  For example,
extra hydrogens can be <a href="../editing/editing.html#deletion">deleted</a>,
and <a href="../../UsersGuide/idatm.html">atom types</a> can be edited
(before hydrogen addition)
with <a href="../../UsersGuide/midas/setattr.html"><b>setattr</b></a>
or <a href="../editing/editing.html"><b>Build Structure</b></a>.
</p>
<li> <b>Add charges</b> - 
call <a href="../addcharge/addcharge.html"><b>Add Charge</b></a> 
to assign partial charges to atoms. 
Partial charges are assigned as an atom 
<a href="../defineattrib/defineattrib.html#attribdef">attribute</a> 
named <b>charge</b> and will be included in <a href="#mol2">Mol2 output</a>.
<p>
Charges for <b><i>standard</i></b> residues
(water, standard amino acids, standard nucleic acids, and a few common 
variants and capping groups) are taken from
<a href="http://ambermd.org/index.html" target="_blank"><b>Amber</b></a>
(<a href="../addcharge/addcharge.html#standard">details</a>).
If any atoms in standard residues are not recognized, a warning will appear
and information on the atoms will be sent to the
<a href="../../UsersGuide/reply.html"><b>Reply Log</b></a>.
Cases of unrecognized atoms in standard residues and/or incorrect net charges
should be 
<a href="../addcharge/addcharge.html#resolved">examined and resolved</a>.
</p><p>
Charges for <b><i>nonstandard</i></b> residues, if any,
are calculated using Amber's 
<a href="http://ambermd.org/antechamber/antechamber.html" 
target="_blank"><b>Antechamber</b></a> module (included with Chimera; 
publications involving its use should cite the 
<a href="../addcharge/addcharge.html#antechamber-ref">reference</a>). 
It is necessary to specify the formal charge of each nonstandard residue
and which <a href="../addcharge/addcharge.html#antechamber-method">charge
calculation method</a> should be used.
</p>
<li> <a name="mol2"><b>Write Mol2 file</b></a> - open a dialog for
  <a href="../../UsersGuide/savemodel.html#mol2">saving Mol2 files</a>;
  options include saving coordinates relative to the untransformed
  coordinates of a particular model, generating an @SET section containing the 
  <a href="../../UsersGuide/selection.html">selected</a> atoms 
  (as used to specify the rigid portion of a ligand in 
  <a href="http://dock.compbio.ucsf.edu/index.html" target="_blank">DOCK</a>),
  and saving multiple models in a single file or multiple files
</ul>
<b>OK</b> performs the specified tasks and dismisses the <b>Dock Prep</b>
dialog, while <b>Cancel</b> simply dismisses the dialog.
<b>Help</b> opens this manual page in a browser window.
</p><p>
Tasks are performed in the order listed on the <b>Dock Prep</b> dialog.
If any individual step is canceled, subsequent steps will not be performed;
for example, if charge assignment is canceled, a Mol2 file will not be written.
To skip a particular step, uncheck its option before initiating the
<b>Dock Prep</b> calculation.
</p>

<a name="limitations">
<h4>LIMITATIONS</h4></a>
<p>
<b>Does not build missing segments.</b>
Structures may have missing residues or atoms where coordinates could
not be determined because of disorder or flexibility.  
<b>Dock Prep</b> can fix <a href="#truncated">truncated sidechains</a>,
but it will not build missing backbone segments.
