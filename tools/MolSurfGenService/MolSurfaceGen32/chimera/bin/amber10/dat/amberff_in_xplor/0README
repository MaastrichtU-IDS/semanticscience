These are files prepared by Tom Cheatham, that will be useful for CHARMM
users who want to run the Cornell et al. Amber force field inside the CHARMM 
program.  See ../charmmff_in_amber for the reverse, to run CHARMM and
similar force fields in the Amber program.

Converted from CHARMM format to Xplor format by Tom Simonson, July, 2000.
