This files created by Jim Caldwell, Jan. 2002

They contain information on how the solvent boxes (in ../leap/lib) were
created.  Most users should not need to concern themselves with these files,
but they are maintained here as paradigms of how new solvent boxes might be
created.

In all the *.lib files, Jim adjusted the box size by hand to match that of
the equilibrated coordinate file rather than leave the LEaP generated box
which is usually about 1.5 angstroms too big in each dimension.
