    setBox unit [ buffer OR buffer_xyz_list ]

The setBox command adds a periodic box to the UNIT, turning it 
into a periodic system for the simulation programs.  It does not add any
solvent to the system, but otherwise works the same way as the 
solvateBox command.  See that command for a description of the buffer
variable, which determines how far away the box boundaries are from
the atoms of the unit.
