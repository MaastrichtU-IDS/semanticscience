# Introduction #

The Semanticscience Integrated Ontology (SIO) provides a simple, integrated ontology of types and relations for rich description of objects, processes and their attributes. The SIO paper has now been  [published](http://www.jbiomedsem.com/content/5/1/14).

The OWL2 ontology is available at http://semanticscience.org/ontology/sio.owl
